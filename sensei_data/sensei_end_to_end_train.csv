Comment 1: Who are ""the rich""? To some, a person earning 50k is rich. But if they rent in London and have children they won't feel at all rich. Some CIFers define rich as anyone with more money than them.

Comment 2: But then surely the same Tory mantra of ""well, if you can't afford to live there you should move somewhere cheaper"" applies to them as much as it does to a cleaner, binman etc, and they should uproot their families immediately?

Comment 3: I agree with both of your points. I don't think someone earning 50k is rich, probably below average if living in London. In my opinion we do need a more progressive tax system. There is something far wrong with our system when the super rich, by that I mean the top 1 to 10% have doubled their wealth recently while everyone else has seen their personal finances worsen. If the government focused more on tax evasion/ avoidance there wouldn't be any short fall in funding. Forcing EVERY corporation to pay their taxes based on profits made here would also make sense.

Comment 4: So define rich.

Comment 5: Nope, where is the evidence?

Comment 6: There's something wrong if we have parts of our country that people on £50,000 a year can't afford to live in, I earn a decent salary, so does my partner, we're by no means poor but we couldn't afford to live in London even if we wanted to, it's an incredibly unhealthy situation

Comment 7: Since when, have those earning double the average wage, suddenly become entitled to the consider themselves 'not rich' or what they can't say 'poor' (because it would be unseemly) . What utter bollocks! All those out there with spread sheets of travel costs in the capital, don't bother. There are millions living weekly between £75 -£150. And they are constantly told to be grateful.

Comment 8: Agree you are lucky if you manage to earn anywhere near the average wage unless you work in the be all and end all of London.  I wonder how some people would manage if they had no benefits to top up their wages. For a single person earning £13,000 means you cannot get Working Tax Credit and at £15,000 housing benefits stop. Yet I am being told asking for a living wage of £18,000 is basically taking the piss out of employers! Anyone got any spare kids I can borrow?

Comment 9: Then, by your very comments you are not rich. When you hear someone working as a contractor, they are typically paying a low tax rate - this practise is endemic in oil and gas, government outsourced contracts and higher payed staff in many large corporations.  If you have children and services are cut because of a low tax base - you will feel poorer as you will need to pay the difference. Lets not go into amazon for example, who distroy other businesses whilst paying NO TAX. Even the vat they charge goes to Luxembourg.

Comment 10: they are the ""hard working"" people of the nation..... who are constantly being patronised by the mega rich tory boys. don't ever forget.... ""we are all in this together"".like h*ll we are..............

Comment 11: Great, let the proles squabble amongst themselves which of their number should consider themselves 'rich' (clue anyone who is 'a couple of paychecks away from the street' as they would say in the US, ain't rich), whilst the oligarchs get on with the job of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/09/billionaires-basements-london-houses-architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">chiselling Olympic sized swimming pools and full-sized ballrooms underneath their London pads</a> and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/26/superyacht-billionaires-helipads-tennis-courts"" rel=""nofollow"">furnishing their yachts</a> with musical waterfalls and flocks of scented sheep and the like.

Comment 12: Who then will provide those services. Let alone teachers, nurses, police etc who cannot afford to live in the communities they serve.

Comment 9: In particular get rid of the loopholes which enable Amazon & their like to virtually avoid paying any tax in this country.

Comment 10: well.......the 'poor' can hardly take much more...but those that come from abroad to use the NHS should have the funds available to pay...then a tax on companies (large corporations etc) whose businesses depend on our infrastructure of education and health for their workers...lets see now....stop all unnecessary operations, face lifts, breast enlargements, etc, change the way the NHS purchases items and consolidate the buying procedures for the most common items (light bulbs etc) as the variable in costs are staggering (28p for a needle at one hospital, over £3 at another for example)...and I'm sure that we can come up with more...reduce the number of managers, bring back the matrons..etc etc etc etc...... why is it that we the public can see whats wrong, yet those who are supposed to be 'experts' are nothing but a bunch of self serving twats

Comment 11: This is an interesting idea, 'raising taxes in many cases leads to tax revenue falling'. So therefore a 10p in the £ reduction will see a huge increase in tax revenue. Why not instead pay everyone a decent living wage allowing workers a decent standard of living. How much do the taxpayers fork out to subsidies companies who exploit their workforce. It was always said that a company's main asset is its workers. Now this same workforce is seen as something to be abused with the vile Tories looking to cut closer to the bone. European human rights and 'Red tape' (health and safety) are something their fat cat donors are keen to abolish. They haven't got enough stashed away off-shore out of reach of the evil 'man/woman' in the street dependant on investment in our country. No, they must have more and more and more. There is never enough money just lying there doing nothing.

Comment 13: The rich do not want to pay any tax, hence their huge avoidance of it. To maintain that they're quite prepared to pay tax at 45% is simply naive. They will have to be forced. It's that simple.

Comment 14: Getting the likes of Google, Vodaphone, Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks etc should be paying their fair share before any personal taxes are increased. We are already effectively subsidising them.

Comment 2: Raising tax hurts growth and therefore in many cases actually leads to tax revenue falling. So while in theory a tax raise may sound good in reality all it will achieve is to make everyone poorer

Comment 3: Growth is a bad thing. It is a finite and rapidly diminishing world. We NEED negative growth if we are to stand any chance of survival.

Comment 5: I don't think you have to raise taxes for everyone. It could start by raising the taxes of the percentage who have doubled their wealth in the last five years, while everyone else has suffered from austerity measures. Have a look at this link. We were supposed to be ""All in it together"" Do you remember that statement?http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2631817/The-rich-richer-Britains-wealthiest-worth-519billion.html

Comment 7: Aww... isn't it sweet! Someone just heard about the Laffer curve and thought we were on the far side of the peak. Bless.

Comment 8: and by coincidence, on the same day the guardian tells us more about 'waste'......http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/26/nhs-managers-redundancy-payments-total about £1.5 billion in redundancy payouts...to people who are back working in the NHS 2-3 months later...staggering this really is a true 'merry-go-round'

Comment 9: The average person already pays over 30% of their income in tax and a large minority pay around 50% so yes I would say we are way over the peak

Comment 10: That's simply not true.....lot's of right wingers think it is true, we get it shoved down our throats all the time however it is simply not true. The most recent example is in Kansas where they genuinely believed that cutting tax would raise revenue and they could not have been more wrong as you can read in the NYT: Q. 'Yes, if You Cut Taxes, You Get Less Tax RevenueKansas Tax Cut Leaves Brownback With Less Money ....Kansas has a problem. In April and May, the state planned to collect $651 million from personal income tax. But instead, it received only $369 million.' Source: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/upshot/kansas-tax-cut-leaves-brownback-with-less-money.html?_r=0

Comment 11: <blockquote>  So while in theory a tax raise may sound good in reality all it will achieve is to make everyone poorer </blockquote>  The reality is quite the reverse. The period that saw the greatest growth in the US, for instance, was the same period that saw their rich taxed at the highest levels.

Comment 12: In your dreams. 1% on NI would raise £8bn. That doesn't go far when the NHS is forecast to be £30bn short soon. Quite how it manages to overspend that much on a £100bn budget is a mystery, but no doubt the minister will have an answer.

Comment 13: It's pretty easy to demonstrate that you're wrong. When the top rate of tax was increased, more money was raised than in the previous year, and when the tax was cut again, revenue fell. Case closed. Incidentally, if you think we're on the far side of the peak, you should have fair idea of where that peak is. Care to share?

Comment 14: The peak of the Laffer curve is about 48% in a modern economy

Comment 15: The problem is that people won't bother to earn more money if 95% of it goes to the government. When Thatcher reduced the top rate of tax to 40%, tax revenues increased.

Comment 16: You're forgetting that whilst income tax has been reduced, consumption taxes such as VAT have massively increased....and then there's council tax too with it's ludicrously punitive and narrow banding.  This shift has been most harshly felt by those on lower incomes as the proportion of their income they pay in taxes has risen whilst that of the 'rich', high earners, wealthy individuals & families alike and large corporates , has fallen substantially. Add into that the massive growth in tax avoidance schemes and a blind eye turned to much of the tax evasion and it all adds up to a huge problem....

Comment 17: They leave the country and they pay no tax. Why do you think so many of the rich moved abroad. 45% tax in the treasury is a great deal more than 95% on no one.

Comment 18: The people to whom that applies contribute little of lasting value, so why worry? I can live without the late (well, he looks late) Mick Jagger and kleptomaniac oligarchs, thanks... ... and we have seen Saint Margaret's legacy: it's not pretty, with pound shops, Wonga, food banks and fake debt collectors masquerading as public utilities.

Comment 19: The largest mass emigration from this country was in 1985 when Thatcher was cutting taxes!  <blockquote>  45% tax in the treasury is a great deal more than 95% on no one. </blockquote>  There is more tax avoidance today than there ever was in the past when income tax was higher. While income tax has reduced other taxes have been introduced and increased. The only difference is the burden of tax is now borne by low to middle earners while the rich have seen their contribution fall significantly.  <blockquote>  Why do you think so many of the rich moved abroad. </blockquote>  Because they are greedy and will never have enough! We should adopt the American policy where ex pats have to fill in tax returns and if they are paying less tax abroad they have to pay the difference or give up their citizenship!

Comment 20: <blockquote>  When Thatcher reduced the top rate of tax to 40%, tax revenues increased. </blockquote>  The tax take has fallen.

Comment 21: The rich do not want to pay any tax, hence their huge avoidance of it. To maintain that they're quite prepared to pay tax at 45% is simply naive. They will have to be forced. It's that simple.

Comment 22: The people to whom that applies contribute little of lasting value, so why worry? This is the same chain of logic that always shows up in this argument: ""If we put taxes up a lot we'll get loads of money!"" ""Very high taxes reduce revenue because people leave and you get nothing from them"" ""Well, we don't want them here anyway!"" But you DID want them here. Because you wanted MORE tax off them, not LESS.

Comment 23: You shouldn't believe all the hysterical tosh in the press about tax (sadly the Graun isn't immune). When you take into account tax paid and benefits received, only about half the taxpayer population actually pays net tax. Food, water and rent don't attract VAT (which is as it should be) and the top 1% of earners pay about 28% of all the income tax, plus a huge slug of VAT on their high spending. Assuming the state needs £30bn to sort out the NHS, and with about effectively 15m taxpayers, it's only an extra £2,000 each in tax or NI. Go for it, and watch the remaining votes going down the plughole. It might be doable after an election, but not as a manifesto commitment. Then again, if it *was* a manifesto commitment, they would do the opposite after the election anyway.

Comment 24: There is more tax avoidance today than there ever was in the past Absolute drivel. Don't believe the hysterical tosh in the press. HMRC has cracked down so hard that very few people try any more. The finance directors of large companies and most wealthy people I speak to are completely paranoid about their company being named and shamed because of the baying crowd of ignoramuses with pitchforks being egged on by ill-informed politicians and newspapers. The whole tax avoidance debate has been hijacked - the politicians want everyone to believe that current tax rates would be OK to fund all the services people want if only the evil tax avoiders would stop. HMRC estimated avoidance costs about £7bn and evasion £7bn. The NHS apparently needs £30bn. Go figure.

Comment 25: The people to whom that applies contribute little of lasting value, so why worry? Except that during the supertax years it was not just the likes of Jagger leaving in droves. Lots of scientists and engineers also left and I think the same will happen again if taxes go up too high.

4,We should vote for the Liberal Democrats.,"Main topic: We should vote for the Liberal Democrats.

Comment 1: This is just the Guardian banging the drum for the LibDems. Their wet dream is that after the next election the Labour Party will have to rely on support from the tiny rump of LibDems that survive the coming apocalypse to form a government. However, I think we've already established that they don't need to have any policies in common for the LibDems to be prepared to sell their souls for a ministerial car or two.

Comment 2: The policy could form one point of future agreement for a coalition with Labour what makes the ConDems think they will have any MPs after the next election?

Comment 3: Because Labour will only get 35-36% of the vote if they're lucky. The likelihood of them getting an outright majority again is slim, although they will get far more MPs than they deserve because of our corrupt FPTP voting system.  They do not deserve to govern alone again, nor should they be allowed to, given their appalling track record.

Comment 4: We will be judging the Lib Dems on their period in government, not a pretty sight. They have signed up eagerly for every extreme right wing policy, the majority of which were in neither the Lib Dem or the Tory manifestos. The people who do not deserve to be in government again are the Tories and the Lib Dems, who lied to the electorate.  I would be very surprised if the electorate fall for any Lib Dem promise in 2015. People who voted Lib Dem in 2010 to stop Tory policies won't be fooled again.

Comment 5: Yes, and the way things are going the Lib Dems riding on a wave of popularity for the way they have curbed Tory excess over the last five years are quite likely to hold a significant number of seats, giving them the balance of power in a close fought election. The trusted and well liked Nick Clegg will then be in a strong position to make a post election pact with Milliband and form a new left of centre coalition government. Seems like a real strong possibility to me.

Comment 6: If a govt proposes something that was not in the manifesto,they should be made to have a referendum.

Comment 7: <blockquote>  although they will get far more MPs than they deserve because of our corrupt FPTP voting system. </blockquote>  The Tories got 36% of the vote and 47% of the seats! FPTP isn't corrupt it's just not PR.   <blockquote>  They do not deserve to govern alone again, nor should they be allowed to, given their appalling track record. </blockquote>  HA HA HA HA! Pathetic.

Comment 8: All our parties are shit, but the Tories are not only that, they're cruel and incompetent too.

Comment 9: I'm sure the Labour Party were suggesting exactly that pretty recently, although the Liberals could never be seen to agree with Labour, just like the bedroom tax that they now oppose but wouldn't vote against, or the mansion tax that they liked until labour suggested one, so they come up with some bollocks about an NHS tax, which they'd drop anyway if they went into another coalition with the Tories, because they are unprincipled whores who will do anything to stay in government

Comment 10: Yes, the Lib Dems voted for the Bedroom Tax and have been defending it for 3 years until about a couple of weeks ago. Could that have anything to do with an election looming nearer?

Comment 11: Labour are no better than the Lib Dems on this: the only tiny difference is that they beat them to the same trick by a few months. Labour voted for the bedroom tax too, and defended it for some months afterwards -- to the extent that in Holyrood, Labour voted no less than five different times to kybosh the Scottish government's attempts to mitigate the effects of the bedroom tax . They insisted that the Scottish government did not have the right to set aside the £40m they found in the budget to pay it. Even though the devolution settlement is explicit that all powers not explictly retained are devolved. Labour in Scotland finally got Labour in London to understand how unpopular it was making SLab, and stopped opposing the SG measure -- as long as the SG agreed to go cap in hand to Westminster and ask for special permission to pay the tax communally. Labour immediately tweeted that they had ""saved Scotland from the council tax"" that they voted for. And of course, Labour councils continue to evict the vulnerable people who fall into rent arrears as a result. The three shades of shite are only distinguishable by their timing.

Comment 12: Who cares what the LibDems think? They'll just rip up their policies and do what their told by the majority coalition partner if they ever get near to power again.

Comment 13: Because he has a modicum of intelligence and won't fall for the Lib Dem spin.

Comment 14: Also, I would imagine that this time, if they do get in a coalition government they will have far fewer MPs and will not have anything like the power of veto that they tell us they have been exercising during this last 4 years and have thus been able to water down the Tory's policies! They will have to do exactly what they are told, and they will do it if it means they have a place in government! They really are quite shameless!

Comment 15: Because just like me and many others, he doesn't believe a fucking word they say.

Comment 16: <blockquote>  should there be coalition negotiations in 2015. </blockquote> Oh no you wont, Labour. If you even hint that you might go into coalition with LibDems, you can waive any support goddbye.

5,"National Insurance is for funding benefits and pensions, not the NHS. ","Main topic: National Insurance is for funding benefits and pensions, not the NHS. 

Comment 1: No, National Insurance is supposed to pay for benefits and state pension, not the NHS, however social security costs are about £12bn higher than the money received from National Insurance so some of that money is spent from other sources.

Comment 2: No. We collectively pay £106bn in NI per year. £85bn is spent on benefits earned by paying NI (97% of that is state pensions). £21bn is diverted to the NHS. Total social security spend is £180bn (including all the means-tested benefits that have nothing to do with NI, paid for out of taxes). On top of that, the state pays out £21bn in tax credits (social security with a different label on it, also paid for out of taxes). NHS England has a budget of about £95bn on top of that, so about 20% of NHS funding comes from NI. 1% on employers' and employees' NI, when Gordon Brown imposed it in 2003, raised about £8bn for the NHS. Thresholds are now higher, so it might raise a bit less if they did it again (assuming nobody lost their job because of the extra cost loaded onto employers, which is far from a given).

Comment 3: National Insurance doesn't pay for the whole of the NHS however it does pay towards some of it, it is not just for benefits and state pension as you claim.

Comment 4: For the year 2012-13, the government collected £103.8bn from National Insurance receipts - http://www.publicspendingfacts.co.uk/tag/breakdown-of-tax-revenues-in-uk/ and spent £114bn on Social Security, £139bn on State Pensions, and £124bn on health care - http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/breakdown_2013UKbt_14bc5n

Comment 5: <blockquote>  No, National Insurance is supposed to pay for benefits and state pension, not the NHS </blockquote>  In 1947 the act dealing with National insurance was changed to include payments to the NHS. A portion of the receipts from National insurance have been transferred to the NHS ever since. I'm afraid you are talking bollocks!

Comment 6: <blockquote>  and spent £114bn on Social Security </blockquote>  The National insurance fund only pays contribution based benefits, the first six months of unemployment benefit to those who have contributed NI payments for two years. It doesn't pay income based benefits such as income based job seekers allowance, tax credits or any other benefit. It pays towards contribution based pensions, it doesn't pay towards the income based level of pensions or pension credits. Until 2009 the National insurance fund was in surplus. During recessions it's accepted that it may go into the red and we are just coming out of a recession. The website you linked to is not correct in stating that National Insurance is a tax. To be a tax it would have to be available for general government expenditure. In fact the funds are spent on very specific areas. Any surplus in the fund is borrowed by the Government and repaid with 8% interest!

7,The economic situation is worse for young people today than it was in the 70s.,"Main topic: The economic situation is worse for young people today than it was in the 70s.

Comment 1: <blockquote>  Stop polarising </blockquote>  There is more to the cost of living than simply wages, as discussed in the recent JRF articles. Housing costs are a crucial factor. The article implies that older people are worse off because they earn less. I'm simply saying that because their housing costs will generally be lower than a younger person buying today then they are probably not worse off at all when you factor this in. Most people just want a comfortable standard of living, and are not driven by a desire to get rich. If you have no housing costs and commuting costs then you could probably live quite comfortably on £1000 a month.

Comment 2: <blockquote>  or are using retirement savings to help them find a place of their own. </blockquote>  A great many now retired used their family sized homes as a pension fund .... and when they can, they are downsizing and living off the proceeds, to help make ends meet. Others are just building debts on 0% credit card deals that will be paid off from their estate. The ONS twerps really have no idea which way is up... trying to draw conclusions about stuff that they have zero data on. and even less reasoning kit..

Comment 3: i started work in 1971 aged 17. I earned £48 a month gross in the civil service which had a very large incremental scale in those days, so young workers were paid a lot less than older colleagues doing the same work. i was in my late 40s/early 50s before my salary (having left the civil service) hit the average earnings figure. i purchased my house in 1981 and was shortly afterwards hit by raised interest rates of 15%. clothing and white goods were, relative to today's prices, very much more expensive eg a washing machine would cost 1 months salary. the rise in mortgage payments was a big struggle - can remember when i had a choice between buying a new dishcloth or a lightbulb, but couldn't afford to buy both. i was a single parent, with child-minder fees to pay - no help there at that time. the time in my 50s when i was earning decent money, and my daughter was at university (she fell for the first year of student loans) was pretty short lived. in 2007, with the end of my mortgage in sight, i re-mortgaged so that i could help my daughter pay off some of her student debt, a decision i made due to her circumstances. in 2009 my employer, a voluntary organisation was in financial difficulties, and for a year we didn't know when we would be paid, or how much of our salary would be paid, until the organisation collapsed in to insolvency in October 2010. i was lucky enough to transfer, with my project to a partner organisation, but part time - 3and a half days a week, instead of full time, and took a £500 a month pay cut. just under 2 years later i was made redundant due to legal aid reforms destoying my profession, 18 months shy of age 60, and 3 months away from finally clearing my mortgage on my 2 bedroom starter home. i had known for a long time that i was in the transitional group of women affected by the equalisation of pension age and wouldn't receive my state pension until the age of 63 and 9 months, but this has now been increased to 65 and 3 months. i've pretty much lived hand to mouth throughout my 41 year working life, and although i now own my little house, i will not make any profit on it - the main charge against baby-boomers - i obviously have very bad timing and keep missing boats. having reached 60, i now live on my small civil service pension and am reconciled to my reduced circumstances, since being unfairly sanctioned by the jobcentre over christmas 2012, which caused me to give up looking for work. my income has fallen from over £26,000 in 2010 to £8000.

Comment 4: They forgot to tell you women get screwed by marital breakdown especially if they have children.  Also unless your daughter's student loans were from a bank you shouldn't have paid them off. The old student loans where mortage style loans which you could defer with ease.

Those who make the wrong choices complain and become aggrieved and those who've made the right choices are enjoying life and the pleasures of economic security Take responsibility and stop blaming external forces

Comment 2: <blockquote>  Take responsibility and stop blaming external forces </blockquote>  Yes, right. 'Move along, nothing to see here!'

Comment 3: <blockquote>  Some adults make the right choices while some make the wrong choices. </blockquote> Life isn't anywhere close to being that simple.

Comment 4: <blockquote>  Take responsibility and stop blaming external forces </blockquote> What, by organising yourselves into workers' organisations and challenging the status quo imposed by employers and government, refusing to comply with requirements until certain demands regarding employment conditions and remuneration are met. What an excellent idea. Now what could we call such organisations of the labour force?

Comment 5: What do you mean by wrong and right and what do you mean by choices?  Some people have the 'choice' to be born into a situation which affords them certain perks. Most other people do not have that choice.  Apparently I made the latter choice, which in hindsight was the wrong choice. My parents made the wrong choice to be unable to be educated fully due to the cost of education so instead made the wrong choice of living off rice and beans while working in subsistence jobs. My father made the right choice to be a hard worker who was eventually recognised and so became a supervisor.  Some choices you can make and some choices are forced on you, some choices are 'right' and some are not but you can never know which it will be until afterwards. I dropped out of university which ended up being the right choice but at the time looked like the wrong choice.

Comment 6: And here already is the classic I'm alright Jack selective view.  I completely refuse to acknowledge any good fortune on my part, because that might make me feel sorry for those less fortunate. I know, better pretend that everyone who is less fortunate is simply feckless scum who brought misery on themselves. Yes, I'll hate the poor. Now I feel better. Oh, hang on, I still don't feel better. Now I'm full of hatred. Who's fault is that? I know, it's the lefties and the poor, they made me feel like this. Better punish them - there, now I feel better. Oh, hang on, no I don't........and so on and so on, forever and ever, Amen

Comment 7: <blockquote>  Some adults make the right choices while some make the wrong choices. </blockquote>  Actually, if you're born into wealth then you'll more than likely end up wealthy. Conversely, if you're born into poverty... As the American saying goes: ""He was born at third base but thought he'd hit a home run.""  <blockquote>  Take responsibility and stop blaming external forces </blockquote>  Ah, a follower of the fucked up failed screenwriter, Ayn Rand, who probably doesn't even know that she hated libertarians.

Comment 8: <blockquote>  And here already is the classic I'm alright Jack selective view. </blockquote>  That's one element. The other is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">hindsight bias</a>. If the end result is OK, however unlikely the prospects or however poor the thought process and decision making, then Mirabeaux will be there to say that ""the right choices were clearly made"". Conversely, if the outcome is bad, however solid the thought process and decision making, then the ""wrong choices were clearly made"", Mirabeaux would tell us, even if the outcome was the result of freak circumstances ...

Comment 9: Quite. Or, to put it in even simpler terms - good luck affects most people in one of two ways: The first group try to conceal their good luck by making up nonsense about the unlucky to make it seem like the unlucky made and deserve the bad luck and they can keep their winnings, guilt-free. The second group don't even understand that they're lucky but instead believe every bit of guff they trump out of their mouths. Well, It worked for me. And I'm great!  Incidentally, I believe the second group is more typically your champagne socialists and the first are your straight ahead Tories.

Comment 10: <blockquote>  Take responsibility and stop blaming external forces </blockquote>  So when crops fail in, say, South Sudan all they have to do, in order not to starve, is to make some of those 'right choices.'  I'll bet they don't even know it's that simple. Maybe you could pop over there and educate them?

Comment 11: Most adults make the right choices by luck as do those making the wrong choices (bad luck) . It has very little indeed to do with a superior mindeset of one group over the anorther.  Unless you have had good luck. In that case wrap it up in smugness.

Anyone with pension savings can access them from age 55, not just the public sector. Normal retirement age in the current civil service pension scheme is 65, and will be linked to state pension age in the new scheme from April 2015.

Comment 4: ....University Education was never free. University Grants were mean tested, and once graduates completed their Undergraduate Training, and commenced employment, the graduate employee returned a fair payment to the system through tax and higher productivity.

No credible political party would wish to be associated with an aura of dishonesty, or complicit in Money Laundering.

Comment 5: Only grants were means tested and rather loosely at that, but there was no tuition fee. Graduates now leave university with a large debt which will have to be paid for from their earnings. That will take a large chunk of their extra earnings, so perhaps they won't be any better off.

Comment 2: <blockquote>  is this what equals journalism? regurgitating ONS statistics without a smidge of critical enquiry? </blockquote>  I think this just reports the facts rather than an in-depth investigation or op-ed. Having one doesn't cancel out the others.

Comment 3: If the journalist cannot be bothered to actually do more than this then frankly - an article saying, ONS report on labour market history published you can read it (link here), would be just about as informative.  Why won't this newspaper do what papers are supposed to do actually inform their readers rather than simply picking a headline worthy of the Daily Mail to misinform them.

12,Older workers are in a worse economic situation than younger workers.,"Main topic: Older workers are in a worse economic situation than younger workers.

Comment 1: Older workers will generally have lower housing costs as their mortgage will have been paid off. Therefore there is less incentive and need to earn more. They won't feel worse off at all, probably far from it. And as the article rightly says, many will be thinking about retiring.

Comment 2: I definitely feel worse off and I am. Started work in late 70s, have secured appropriate qualifications -even invested in some more this year. I think of retiring and know I never will. Got mortgage in 2006, (post grad and appropriate qualifications for two sectors) and provide home for self and two students. I have applied for hundreds of jobs with necessary experience and qualifications to match, or more usually exceed stated requirements. Thanks to linkedin, I get to see how they prefer younger people for the roles. I have struggled for jobs in a number of recessions as primarily worked in the privater sector but this the worst.  I am earning less now than I did in 1990 and will be hoping for a step up by queuing at one of Aldi's infamous open day's for new staff this Saturday.

Comment 3: <blockquote>  Therefore there is less incentive and need to earn more. </blockquote>  Therefore they 'choose' not to be richer? I suspect for most of them choice doesn't enter into it.

Comment 4: Exactly. Because, believe me, given the choice I'd be working more and earning more. The fact my mortgage is paid off has allowed me to continue in my home, though it's a struggle and we may have to sell.

Comment 5: Therefore there is less incentive and need to earn more. Bit of a sweeping generalisation. Many of us still have the costs of adult kids living at home, or are using retirement savings to help them find a place of their own. Not all older workers own, those that rent have seen rents increase while wages have at best stagnated. Of those that do own, many have seen their wages eaten up by inflation and low/no wage increases. None of this is new to anyone, all of us, young and old are in the same boat, stagnant wages and increasing living costs. Stop polarising.

Comment 6: <blockquote>  Stop polarising </blockquote>  There is more to the cost of living than simply wages, as discussed in the recent JRF articles. Housing costs are a crucial factor. The article implies that older people are worse off because they earn less. I'm simply saying that because their housing costs will generally be lower than a younger person buying today then they are probably not worse off at all when you factor this in. Most people just want a comfortable standard of living, and are not driven by a desire to get rich. If you have no housing costs and commuting costs then you could probably live quite comfortably on £1000 a month.

Comment 7: A beautifully panglossian view of poverty. the poor choose to be poor

Comment 8: I accept that low wage earners may not ""choose"" to be rich, but if everyone chose to be rich, by not spending as much as they earned, the economy would actually grind to a halt.

Comment 9: Says someone who must only understand public sector pension entitlements. Of course if your in your late fifties you can sit back and wait until your lifetime savings have been stolen and your annuity is worth less than you put in. But hey who needs over £8k a year if your over sixty, with no mortgage.You patronising............!

Comment 10: <blockquote>  borris14    03 July 2014 11:21amRecommend19  Older workers will generally have lower housing costs as their mortgage will have been paid off.  </blockquote>  You really haven't digested the article.

Comment 11: <blockquote>  And as the article rightly says, many will be thinking about retiring. </blockquote>  And there again, some of us just got made redundant :-)

Comment 12: <blockquote>  or are using retirement savings to help them find a place of their own. </blockquote>  A great many now retired used their family sized homes as a pension fund .... and when they can, they are downsizing and living off the proceeds, to help make ends meet. Others are just building debts on 0% credit card deals that will be paid off from their estate. The ONS twerps really have no idea which way is up... trying to draw conclusions about stuff that they have zero data on. and even less reasoning kit..

Comment 13: We don't have a choice with what family we're born into bit we do all have a choice about our future. Sure, some of us will never be millionaires because of background and social circles but there really is nothing stopping anyone in this country earning decent standard of living so that they're not poor. People do have a choice. Really.

13,Younger workers are better off than older workers.,"Main topic: Younger workers are better off than older workers.

Comment 1: Contributors often comment that the older generation had an easier time - lower price housing etc. this article suggests that whilst housing may be more expensive, later generations have had greater earnings though many chose to spend on consumer goods instead of housing.

Comment 2: Which would be utter cobblers of course

Comment 3: Go and do the sums many areas housing is only worth 10x that of houses in the seventies. The big difference a decade of low interest rates and no chance of them rising soon. Those buying houses in the north have a great deal thats why mortgages are less than rents. Those starting work in the seventies had interest rates at ten percent to sixteen percent most of their mortgages. So heres a test for you go and find out how much each of those interest rates would make a repayment mortgage of 100k . Go on line and put in the numbers it would bloody shock the lot of you.

Comment 4: <blockquote>  Those starting work in the seventies had interest rates at ten percent to sixteen percent most of their mortgage </blockquote>  And the price of the house would be fraction it was now - so repayments as a proportion of income wouldn't be that massive at 10% interest rates.  Furthermore, incomes were often rising by double digits too, so the mortgage burden was greatly reduced after just 4-5 years. Today, house prices are high, interest rates as low as they'll get, and salary growth is almost non-existent - thus mortgages will remain a heavy burden for 15-20 or more.

Comment 5: Exactly

Comment 6: Erm, my house would have costed a tiny fraction in 1975 of what it does now. Even adjusting for inflation, it's mental. They do not have my sympathy.

Comment 7: Sympathy ? Is this the same generation that picked up the bills while you were growing up? Want to slate someone for house prices? Don't blame me, I had nothing to do with it.

Comment 8: Not blaming anyone, just saying that a young family with a mortgage today has more money worries than someone nearing retirement with a reduced wage.

Comment 9: Only if they've actually paid their mortgage off and they aren't also taking the role of 'the bank of Mum and Dad' as many of us are. You reach sixty and the company want to see you retired but you still have a mortgage to pay and adult offspring to support.

Comment 10: Yes, but a young family with a mortgage in the '70s had just the same worries as their equivalents today, and it will be the same in 10, 20 or 40 years time. Get over it!

Comment 11: Picked up the bills? You mean paid the bills on the 3 bed council house that I grew up in, that they bought on RTB? The 3 bed that would now cost me half a million quid but they bought for 50k? The 3 bed I will almost certainly never be able to afford to live in until I'm twice the age they were when they had a family?

Comment 12: That will be the RTB that was bought in during the '80s by Thatcher will it, not during the '70s which is the time that this article is referring to?

Comment 13: Oh yes, good point. People starting work in 1975 staring to buy a home in 1985. Well, that's just a ridiculous idea. Thanks for pointing out my silly position. Jesus wept

Comment 14: My house bought in 1979 for 11750 is now worth just 125000. So whats the bonus after years of huge interest rates?

Comment 15: But their mortgage was a lot lower relative to income, and they consumed less.

Comment 16: Sure, but it's a bed of your own collective making, the having to support adult children. While you whine about working at 60, my generation doesn't entertain the merest expectation of retiring before 75. We may end up living longer but presumably most of it will be spent sitting around in soiled nappies with dementia - and that's if we're lucky enough to afford the medical bills.

Comment 17: And reading you whining about it makes me believe that you don't deserve anything better.

Comment 18: Ah diddums - I can hear the world's smallest violin and its playing just for you. The reality is that proportionally speaking very few benefited from RTB and most who did had paid rent on their council house for many years that was the equivalent of what a mortgage payment would have been. However I'm sure your over developed sense of entitlement won't allow you to comprehend that.

Comment 19: What utter guff. I am quite literally a man who has no sense of entitlement at all. I have been brought up in an environment that tells me I deserve nothing because of who my parents were and the year I was born.  You sound like Bono wondering why there isn't a strong music industry any more. And then deciding it must be because musicians these days just don't have the passion, man.

Comment 20: RTB started earlier than that. It was a labour policy.

14,Younger workers are better off than older workers.,"Main topic: Younger workers are better off than older workers.

Comment 1: What's with all the anti-50s and over ire in many of these posts? This is a newspaper article based on a report by the Office for National statistics and yet you young 'us are having a go at us oldies as though we're rampaging against our lot.  We were born when we were born, some have done better than others and some will have a better or longer retirement than others. We don't need all the crap being thrown at us in these comments.

Comment 2: I think you'll find, if you are able to be honest, that all the ""anti-50s"" comments are responses/replies to all the pathetic comments from your lot, saying - see, it ain't so peachy. This proves it etc, there's virtually no difference between having a 60k mortgage and paying a grand a month in rent.

Comment 3: <blockquote>  What's with all the anti-50s and over ire in many of these posts? </blockquote>  This is found all over the internet. The main reason is to do with the fact so many of you sit smugly a-top a huge pile of property equity (and yes many could downsize to a nice house and still have masses left over). Here in Herts land reg figures show 5 bed detached homes selling for under £5000 in 1971, so about 2 or 3 times the annual wage. Now those same fairly standard homes are £700k, about 20 times ave' income.

Comment 4: Well try finding those same figures in Hill Doncaster, Bradford, wigan, blackpool do you want me to go on ? We don t all live in the southeast. Even in Newham youll find property that has generally only gone up equivalent do wage inflation. Whilst interest rates have dramatically gone down.

Comment 5: <blockquote>  The main reason is to do with the fact so many of you sit smugly a-top a huge pile of property equity </blockquote>  So many?Maybe in the SE, but I would suggest that if you were to venture north of Watford, or west of Salisbury you might well see a different picture.  <blockquote>  Here in Herts.... </blockquote> Well, you could always move you know.  And your comparison of Average Income is flawed.There is a huge difference in Average Income between the SE and the rest. So, your £700k = 20x Ave might be true for the country as a while, but it isn't true for many who live in the likes of Herts, is it?

Comment 6: In the 70s there were jobs in those areas.

Comment 7: When did they decline was it last year ? or could it have been in the eighties when interest rates were 16% wake up you twits.

Comment 8: so many of you sit smugly a-top a huge pile of property equity Yup that's right - and the reason many of us do this is because it really irritates self righteous whingers who blame everyone but themselves for their standard of living, have an over developed sense of entitlement and believe that houses were just being given away to anyone who wanted one in the 70s and 80s.

Comment 9: Not sure where your numbers come from.I bought a 3 bed terraced townhouse in Luton in 1972 for £6.5k. Could not fine anythng in Watford, Hemel, Stevenage, Hitchen. I had to commute to London, not ideal at all. I can only assume you are quoting a hamlet somewhere near Huntingdon, or are you fibbing?

Comment 10: Computer hiccup. Was just saying thanks for clarification on numbers, I thought they were a bit odd.

Comment 11: The thing about 5 bed detached homes - only a very small percentage of the population live in one.The thing about generally high house prices - they don't do the house owner much good unless you're a last time seller (dead, or need to sell to pay the nursing home fees) or you're trading down, or you're going for equity release to top up an inadequate annuity.

Happy?

Comment 6: <blockquote>  Do your research. Aircraft carriers spend a lot more time on humanitarian missions than engaged in warfare. </blockquote>  Only because they are useless at both.

Comment 7: There is plenty of private investment in renewable energy. This is market driven. Defence is a public good. You have a vote. Vote Labour and become a Putin puppet.

Comment 8: <blockquote>  You have a vote. Vote Labour and become a Putin puppet. </blockquote>  Better oligarchic capitalist than dead. I'm very interested to learn that a Labour government will scrap the aircraft carriers. I thought I kept up with current events, but that policy announcement seems to have escaped me.

Comment 9: He said it was an example of a big nation demonstrating what they do ....... spend countless billions on a vessel that will at best have no aircraft for at least 6-10 years and when there is enough support vessels to defend this hulking lump. Lets gloss over the anti ship ballistic missiles that could render them sitting ducks.

Comment 10: Agree regarding the time scale for fixed wing aircraft, however I'm not so sure about your statement with regards to anti ship missiles. The carrier and it's likeliest escort (Type 45 destroyer) both have SAMPSON radar, the best in the world. Type 45 also has Sea Viper missiles and Phalanx CIWS. Carriers aren't obsolete yet.

Comment 11: It also says : Come on then if you think yer 'ard enuff. A deterrent, a bit expensive, mind.

Comment 12: There isn't an empire anymore and are obsolete.Missiles like the Russian Vulkan are specifically designed to take out the carriers. Throw in developments with drones and carriers will be overwhelmed. Did yoy notice when the US fleet was in the Eastern Mediterranean they recognized the Vulkan danger potential a withdrew their fleet so as to be out of the Varyag's range.

Comment 13: Thankfully not everyone has Vulkan! I would still argue Sea Viper/SAMPSON combination could take out Vulkan. Experiments are currently be done with SAMPSON to see if it can be a 'off the shelf' strategic missile shield.

Comment 14: <blockquote>  Lets gloss over the anti ship ballistic missiles that could render them sitting ducks </blockquote>  There's no such thing as an anti-ship ballistic missile. It would far too easy to shoot out of the sky long before it got close.  But I see your point - it seems silly building any fighting machine when the enemy will just design something to take it out. Shame no-one pointed that out a thousand years ago.

Comment 15: Can they stop an ICBM? At the height of the cold war, eac US Carriers was targeted by a nuke. The problem with carriers is they are meant for projection of force, not defence. What targets do you have in mind for these expensive toys?

Comment 16: A couple of years ago, a F 15 Strike Eagle successfully shot down a satellite. Could a carrier fast jet take out a ICBM? I don't think it's beyond the realms of fantasy. The SAMSON radar (that the carrier has) is capable of picking up ICBM's. In regards to the expensive toys point, I would say fail to prepare, prepare to fail. We only got the Falklands back because of carriers. We were also able to launch air strikes against Serbian forces during the civil war in Yugoslavia.

Comment 17: Vulkan schmulkan. The point is that defence tech is evolving so rapidly that no piece of kit can be said to have a ""50-year life"". It may be that a swarm of $1000 drones, each with a few hundred grams of explosive becomes the unbeatable missile shield. Or that small cheap drones (in numbers) replace fast fixed wing aircraft altogether. Who knows? Even the Vulkan (which is 1980s kit) is a weapon that has a range of hundreds of miles. The days of being within sight of your enemy are long gone. A slow-moving, 65,000 ton target is surely not what you want... I bet the carriers are mothballed or sold off due to obsolescence within a decade.

Comment 18: I doubt that a ballistic missile would render them sitting ducks because they have to be aimed at a fixed point and aircraft carriers are not fixed, they are moving. By the time a ballistic missile arrived the carrier would be elsewhere. Now a submarine is a different matter..............

Comment 19: The RN has only 6 GMD's and 13 Frigates. Now consider refitting and Maintenance periods and leave periods...you should be able to work out how much sea time the new Carriers will get when they eventually get aircraft. They can't go to sea alone as they need a supporting battle group due to the fact that they are a big easy target! However we have plenty ex Admirals who probably believe these ships are a good idea!!!

Comment 20: Good point. Against less high tech adversaries, carriers still have merit.

Comment 21: Just what are you on. Most large radars can pick-up ICBMs. I doubt this toy has the necessary fire-control equipment to control missiles or whatever else to destroy ICBMs. > fail to prepare, prepare to fail. But prepare for what? You still haven't said what mythical enemy we're supposed to be preparing for. The RN has 78 commissioned ships, mostly built for the Cold War. As shown innumerable times, preparing for the last enemy will screw you over every time. Without a fairly big support fleet, you're pretty much screwed in the force projection department. You know, tankers, troop-ships, assault vehicles. The Merchant Navy has no ships to cover the RN's short-comings, and even the RFA has ships rented from the Danes, amusingly enough. Maybe we could rent some destroyers from the Yanks like we do SLBMs? Ah, Britannia. Wherefore art thou? In the meantime we could ask our enemies to wait whilst we arm these ships with some aircraft. Oh, wait. Is the F35 - the most expensive aircraft in history - grounded before it even hits service? Oh dearie me. Quite the little fuck up we have going on here.

Comment 22: Nice aircraft carrier. Shame about the <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8072041/Navy-aircraft-carrier-will-be-sold-after-three-years-and-never-carry-jets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">aircraft</a>.

Comment 23: ugly carrier, as ugly as it namesake, as ugly as the planes that will fly off it. but then I suppose expecting a warship to look good is asking too much. At very least they could have avoided naming it after the head of state, doing so generally brings bad luck to navy ships.

Comment 24: expecting a warship to look good is asking too much  HMS Hood is an example of a warship which looked very good.

Comment 25: I think the ship and its namesake are handsome, the aircraft less so. Bismarck, Tirpitz and Hood were all handsome ships.

Comment 1: Because developing advanced fighter aircraft is hugely more expensive than building a ship. If Scotland chooses independence, Scottish taxpayers are perfectly welcome to build their own ships at Rosyth to maintain jobs.....but don't expect UK to continue supporting jobs in an independent Scotland whilst Salmond proposes to steal jobs from the North of England with cuts in corporation tax and punish UK students studying in Scotland.

Comment 2: You should know by now these contracts go to the Best Bid and the best quality Build .

Comment 3: No they don't. BAE owns shipyards in Scotland and Portsmouth.....those contracts won by BAE could have been allocated to Portsmouth 100% and no doubt BAE won those contracts because the ships would be built in the UK. The only difference in future is that future Royal Navy ships will be built at Portsmouth should Scotland vote for independence. If you believe Salmond, there are no negative consequences for voting for independence. Yup, no lies there!

Comment 4: So incredibly expensive, by the time anyone even thinks of a project that size again I just don't think there will be any question of a single European state attempting it other than in collaboration if at all. The days of the Big National Statement are over, and they seem to have ended in rather a muddle.

Comment 5: <blockquote>  whilst Salmond proposes to steal jobs from the North of England with cuts in corporation tax </blockquote>  Baffling. It's perfectly legitimate to set your own corporation tax if you're a sovereign state. rUK has the ability to match or beat it if they deem fit. This kind of complaining can be done to your elected representative who can take your wishes to anachronistic Westminster to sort out.  It's not for your hypothetical neighbouring nation to disadvantage themselves for the betterment of your economy. This is an argument that I've heard time and time again against iScotland, one that I agree with and one that works both ways.

Comment 6: It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract. Alan Shepard

Comment 7: BAE owns shipyards in Scotland and Portsmouth.....those contracts won by BAE could have been allocated to Portsmouth  Indeed they could so the question is why under the Union, they weren't? You are right to suggest that future ships could be built in Portsmouth but there is an associated premium and disruption for so doing.  That may of course be politically acceptable / desirable.

Comment 8: Because developing advanced fighter aircraft is hugely more expensive than building a ship Its not just development costs, production costs and through life costs that impact upon the decision. Economies of scale suggest you get cheaper aircraft, including through life support costs by building more of them and you can only do that by equipping multinational air-forces. Euro-fighter is likely to be the last combat aircraft developed and manufactured solely in Western Europe - numbers purchased/ planned have already been cut BAE SYSTEMS has been re jigging it's business for the last 20 + years given the inevitable demise/ reduction in business significance of military airframe development and manufacture.

Comment 9: <blockquote>  Scottish taxpayers are perfectly welcome to build their own ships at Rosyth to maintain jobs </blockquote>  There are no more MOD contract ships being built in the forseeable future other than what is already being built.So what do you think will happen to those jobs currently at Rosyth? Westminster will keep them going until September the 19th with false promise of more defence contracts then they will be made redundant, yes or no. The union has nothing more to offer Scotland except poverty and unemployment.

Comment 10: What is baffling is Salmond making outrageous claims to revitalising the Scottish economy based on lower corporation tax that would not invite a retaliatory cut in tax from the UK...... Don't you think under this scenario, this can only be damaging? One might also infer that Holyrood is anachronistic. It only has yes committees for scrutineering the Scottish government.

Comment 11: Not contracts for warships....under EU procurement rules warships are exempt. If we wanted the best price we could buy Arleigh Burkes from the US.

Comment 12: <blockquote>  What is baffling is Salmond making outrageous claims to revitalising the Scottish economy based on lower corporation tax that would not invite a retaliatory cut in tax from the UK...... </blockquote>  You mean like the retaliatory corporation tax cut the UK implemented when Ireland went to 12.5%? The one which didn't happen?

Comment 13: Strange that people are getting all pompous about building two aircraft carriers, when this government has placed an order for FOUR large ships for the RFA in South Korea. Presumably South Korea is part of the rUK, so it's OK to support THEIR shipyards, but not the ones up the road? Bizarre.

Comment 14: Apart from the Type 26 Frigate Programme of 13 vessels.....the POW also has to be finished. If the independence referendum returns a no vote Rosyth will go from QNLZ and POW build to the T26 programme. There has to be substantial investment in the yard, but it is entirely dependent on the referendum outcome. I don't mind either way if Scotland votes yes or no, but for Rosyth the outcome is clear as day. A No vote means closure after POW is completed, a Yes votes means a future beyond that.

Comment 15: No UK yards bid believe it or not, which was a tragedy. As RFA ships as well if we'd wanted to we could have slapped some guns on them, designated them as warships instead of auxiliaries, and made them exempt from EU procurement rules as well (which is what everyone else does). It's likely that the next batch of RFA MARS ships will be on order for them as well, unless someone makes a bid.

Comment 16: BAe and HMG have been entirely clear on this, that in the event of a Yes vote that is what the outcome will definitely be. It's probably the clearest issue in the independence debate. The SNP position that the UK would continue to build them in Rosyth is nonsense as a large government investment is needed in the yard for the T26 programme.

Comment 17: Whereas I agree those ships should have been built here, they're not warships, nor are they part of the Royal Navy. So a bit of a red herring.

Comment 18: Yes, all that info is available, and I read it. However, the principle appears to be that warships - and the RFAs ARE warships by any sensible definition - will be built in the UK. Now, like spolit kids, we're suggesting that warships can be built in Korea, but can't be built in the UK! The ""no-bidder"" from the UK is of course bollocks. How else do we get warships built only in the UK? The politicians are tying themselves in knots (npi).

Comment 19: <blockquote>  Whereas I agree those ships should have been built here, they're not warships, nor are they part of the Royal Navy.    So a bit of a red herring.  </blockquote>  You see this is the ""let's define a Royal Navy ship as something else"" Monty Python approach to politics. On the other hand, I was thinking of holidaying on one of the new Korean ships, but only if P&O aren't using it for refuelling one of their cruise ships with it at the time.

Comment 20: <blockquote>  You should know by now these contracts go to the Best Bid and the best quality Build . </blockquote>  And we all know, by your statement above, that you don't have a clue. Government, strategic spending goes where it likes. It could have made these carriers in Italy or Korea. The UK gov chose the Clyde because it was strategically important to keep the money and skills within the UK. If Scotland votes for independence, it will no longer qualify for rUK strategic spending. BAe will be paid to modify other docks, as it was paid to modify the docks on the Clyde. Even Salmond wasn't stupid enough to make comments like you have, as it is fairly obvious, by the strong union statements etc., he knew it would lack any credibility.

Comment 21: The no bidder was partly due to capacity in the yards, but also was due to the fact that as the competition was opened up (as they weren't designated as warships, which is factually correct and is applying the letter of EU law correctly, despite the fact that no-one else does it) no-one would stand a chance on price competing with a Korean yard as they are way cheaper due to the vast economy of scales they have. they're also much more used to building this type of vessel on a regular basis. The design is still British though, we're still good at that bit.Which really leads us to the point, if the rUK didn't transfer naval shipbuilding to Portsmouth in the event of a Yes vote, and then allowed Rosyth to tender for ship building programmes (which also won't be as big). They still wouldn't get the work as they would be competing with other cheaper shipbuilders (the Koreans incidentally make some fine warships). Either way Rosyth is finished in the event of a Yes vote, it couldn't compete on warship contracts and it already can't compete on merchant ship building.

Comment 22: <blockquote>  You see this is the ""let's define a Royal Navy ship as something else"" Monty Python approach to politics. </blockquote>  And the willful denial of the obvious ""Chamberlain"" approach to politics is prevelant again! Even somebody as deliberately obtuse as yourself can see the difference between a tanker and a capital ship? The Royal Navy deliberately builds capital ships in the UK, to retain skills, technology etc. If Scotland ceases to be part of the UK, it will lose capital ship orders from the rUK. Its really very obvious and simple. I don't get why you keep trying to pretend it is not so. Tankers are not ""high tech"" weapons. So, maybe, if iScotland could produce them cheaper than Korea, they could get the orders from rUK. But, given they haven't already, it seems unlikely.

Comment 23: I don't dispute your statement, rUK tax payer will just have to pick up the bill if or as and when they do. However According to the unions, Babcock had noted the Scottish government's plan to remodel Rosyth and Faslane after independence, but said it remained unclear whether workloads would be smaller or greater than now.

Comment 24: Erm, there is a programme underway to replace the aging Type 23 frigates with the imaginatively named Type 24.

Comment 25: The Type 26 would not be built in Rosyth. Once the Carriers are welded together at Rosyth, thats it. Its only hope of any further work is not defence related, its defence work went to Devonport years ago. However it does have the largest dry dock in the UK and the only one big enough for the white elephants with no planes.

Comment 26: ...don't expect UK to continue supporting jobs in an independent Scotland...  Tell me what authority you have of making that statement? Are you a government minister or just a deluded blowhard? As an ordinary voter you have no say in the matter. There are so many people who like to voice opinions which are totally groundless.

Comment 27: <blockquote>  The union has nothing more to offer Scotland except poverty and unemployment. </blockquote>  Has Scotland anything better to offer the rest of the UK? It would be nice to see a little more discussion about whether the 55 million would be better or worse off without the 5 million and to have a vote on it.

Comment 28: whilst Salmond proposes to steal jobs from the North of England with cuts in corporation tax and punish UK students studying in Scotland. Excuse me? You've got a vote, why do you waste it on a UK government that doesn't provide jobs in the north of England, and punishes English students with outrageously high student fees? (Hint: the Scottish grant doesn't stretch to giving free education to the whole of the UK). Get yourselves some decent regional parties, the SNP can't be expected to look after areas outside Scotland, although quite a few seem to find it an appealing idea.

Comment 29: I understood they were actually merchant vessels owned by the MOD and crewed by civilians. Not 'warships'. As for the contract going to Korea, an outrage. Though it is a bit rich for many BTL to whinge about this. If it was left to them, they would not be built at all with the money instead frittered away on supporting the cultural elite.

Comment 30: I think the article mentions  <blockquote>  building for a new £4.5bn fleet of 13 Royal Navy Type 26 frigates at Scotstoun - a move that would secure thousands of jobs for years - but only after the referendum. </blockquote>.  Also mentions that no Royal Navy ship would be built outside (r)UK. So, maybe have negative effect.

Comment 31: <blockquote>  building for a new £4.5bn fleet of 13 Royal Navy Type 26 frigates at Scotstoun - a move that would secure thousands of jobs for years - but only after the referendum.    Also mentions that no Royal Navy ship would be built outside (r)UK. So, maybe have negative effect.  </blockquote>  The tories aren't in any position to guarantee anything until after they win the next general election. What if they don't win, will labour honour the tory promises, no they won't, and going on past form any jam the tories promise today they will renege on after a no vote, exactly as they done in 1979. If they won't build ships outside of the UK why are they building ships in South Korea for the MOD?

Comment 32: <blockquote>  What is baffling is Salmond making outrageous claims to revitalising the Scottish economy based on lower corporation tax that would not invite a retaliatory cut in tax from the UK...... </blockquote>  Again, if there isn't a retaliatory cut, catch up with your MP.   <blockquote>  Don't you think under this scenario, this can only be damaging? </blockquote>  Damaging to who? rUK? Not if your MP takes on board your concerns and does something about it.  <blockquote>  One might also infer that Holyrood is anachronistic. It only has yes committees for scrutineering [sic] the Scottish government. </blockquote>  Google ""House of Lords"" and choose another glass house to throw around your stones...

Comment 33: Is there not only 1 more order? After that what then for the shipyards? I've heard the SNP giving possibilities but better together sweep that question under the rug. Warships are antiquated anyway, no need for them anymore.

Comment 34: <blockquote>  There are no more MOD contract ships being built in the forseeable future other than what is already being built. </blockquote>...other than the fleet of 13 Royal Navy Type 26 frigates specifically mentioned in the article you mean.  Just once, could you read the article first.

Comment 35: <blockquote>  Are they the ships they are going to build in Portsmouth, or was it South Korea? </blockquote>No, we don't build these types of ships outside of the UK and again, the contract is in BAE Scotstoun. But construction does not start until after the referendum, and according to the MOD would be moved to (a) domestic UK port/s in the unlikely event that Scotland decided to go.  Seriously, its all at the top of the page.

Comment 36: When last I looked, Appledore (Babcocks), Hebburn (A&P Tyne), Portsmouth (BAE) and Birkenhead (Cammell Laird) were in England. Scottish components supplied by Rosyth, obviously, and Glasgow (BAE Systems again).

Comment 1: if feel that these billions spent on a carried could be spend more wisely. on nhs for instance.

Comment 2: <blockquote>  The First Sea Lord, Sir George Zambellas, came closest to expressing it, calling the £3bn ship ""a national instrument of power"". </blockquote>  Who is he planning to invade now?

Comment 3: He said it was an example of a big nation demonstrating what they do ....... spend countless billions on a vessel that will at best have no aircraft for at least 6-10 years and when there is enough support vessels to defend this hulking lump. Lets gloss over the anti ship ballistic missiles that could render them sitting ducks.

Comment 4: Agree regarding the time scale for fixed wing aircraft, however I'm not so sure about your statement with regards to anti ship missiles. The carrier and it's likeliest escort (Type 45 destroyer) both have SAMPSON radar, the best in the world. Type 45 also has Sea Viper missiles and Phalanx CIWS. Carriers aren't obsolete yet.

Comment 5: It also says : Come on then if you think yer 'ard enuff. A deterrent, a bit expensive, mind.

Comment 6: There isn't an empire anymore and are obsolete.Missiles like the Russian Vulkan are specifically designed to take out the carriers. Throw in developments with drones and carriers will be overwhelmed. Did yoy notice when the US fleet was in the Eastern Mediterranean they recognized the Vulkan danger potential a withdrew their fleet so as to be out of the Varyag's range.

Comment 7: Thankfully not everyone has Vulkan! I would still argue Sea Viper/SAMPSON combination could take out Vulkan. Experiments are currently be done with SAMPSON to see if it can be a 'off the shelf' strategic missile shield.

Comment 8: <blockquote>  Lets gloss over the anti ship ballistic missiles that could render them sitting ducks </blockquote>  There's no such thing as an anti-ship ballistic missile. It would far too easy to shoot out of the sky long before it got close.  But I see your point - it seems silly building any fighting machine when the enemy will just design something to take it out. Shame no-one pointed that out a thousand years ago.

Comment 9: Can they stop an ICBM? At the height of the cold war, eac US Carriers was targeted by a nuke. The problem with carriers is they are meant for projection of force, not defence. What targets do you have in mind for these expensive toys?

Comment 10: A couple of years ago, a F 15 Strike Eagle successfully shot down a satellite. Could a carrier fast jet take out a ICBM? I don't think it's beyond the realms of fantasy. The SAMSON radar (that the carrier has) is capable of picking up ICBM's. In regards to the expensive toys point, I would say fail to prepare, prepare to fail. We only got the Falklands back because of carriers. We were also able to launch air strikes against Serbian forces during the civil war in Yugoslavia.

Comment 11: Vulkan schmulkan. The point is that defence tech is evolving so rapidly that no piece of kit can be said to have a ""50-year life"". It may be that a swarm of $1000 drones, each with a few hundred grams of explosive becomes the unbeatable missile shield. Or that small cheap drones (in numbers) replace fast fixed wing aircraft altogether. Who knows? Even the Vulkan (which is 1980s kit) is a weapon that has a range of hundreds of miles. The days of being within sight of your enemy are long gone. A slow-moving, 65,000 ton target is surely not what you want... I bet the carriers are mothballed or sold off due to obsolescence within a decade.

Comment 12: I doubt that a ballistic missile would render them sitting ducks because they have to be aimed at a fixed point and aircraft carriers are not fixed, they are moving. By the time a ballistic missile arrived the carrier would be elsewhere. Now a submarine is a different matter..............

Comment 13: The RN has only 6 GMD's and 13 Frigates. Now consider refitting and Maintenance periods and leave periods...you should be able to work out how much sea time the new Carriers will get when they eventually get aircraft. They can't go to sea alone as they need a supporting battle group due to the fact that they are a big easy target! However we have plenty ex Admirals who probably believe these ships are a good idea!!!

Comment 14: Good point. Against less high tech adversaries, carriers still have merit.

Comment 15: Just what are you on. Most large radars can pick-up ICBMs. I doubt this toy has the necessary fire-control equipment to control missiles or whatever else to destroy ICBMs. > fail to prepare, prepare to fail. But prepare for what? You still haven't said what mythical enemy we're supposed to be preparing for. The RN has 78 commissioned ships, mostly built for the Cold War. As shown innumerable times, preparing for the last enemy will screw you over every time. Without a fairly big support fleet, you're pretty much screwed in the force projection department. You know, tankers, troop-ships, assault vehicles. The Merchant Navy has no ships to cover the RN's short-comings, and even the RFA has ships rented from the Danes, amusingly enough. Maybe we could rent some destroyers from the Yanks like we do SLBMs? Ah, Britannia. Wherefore art thou? In the meantime we could ask our enemies to wait whilst we arm these ships with some aircraft. Oh, wait. Is the F35 - the most expensive aircraft in history - grounded before it even hits service? Oh dearie me. Quite the little fuck up we have going on here.

Comment 22: Like the abolition of slavery? Or seti? Or defeat of fascism? Or the maintenance of open see lanes? Or the development of medicines? Or or Radar? Or of the jet engine? Or the steam Turbine?

Comment 23: I am Welsh, I live in Wales. I worry greatly about the version of History taught to us. We do not teach ourselves enough of the ills, violence and grievous nature of Empire, we have plowed on with expansionist economic policy which itself morphed out of empire. When the British empire clashed with the other empires in the first and second world wars, it too was involved with persecution of peoples - from the concentration camps in South Africa to the terror inflicted on India, the infliction of a Caste system, the dividing of cultures in pursuit of its own interest. The rich have used us, British citizens, to commit all manners of crimes against humanity over the centuries, and indeed up until this present day. It troubles me that we are not able to turn the eye of scrutiny in on this embedded brutal nature, but proceed with a tired superiority complex. It will not bode well for us in a global world that is changing rapidly, either to continue our pursuit of aggressive foreign policy or to ignore the ills of the past, we must as a culture evolve peacefully or face destruction - that is my view.

26,The police and government should not have access to people's personal data. ,"Main topic: The police and government should not have access to people's personal data. 

Comment 1: On top of Ron's points I'd add that the police have a poor understanding of Data Protection Act rules i.e. what they can share with which organisations with/without consent. GP's are pretty good at this. Even when they share personal data with a hospital consultant as part of a referral they obtain the patient's consent. Conversely, Social Workers regularly phone up my GP wife asking for patient medical details - she says ""Fine - just fax me through the patient consent"" and that's the last she hears of it. Whether they are actually ignorant of the law or just trying it on, I don't know. Your medical records are between you and your GP and nobody has access to them without your consent. There are one or two exceptions, child protection but even then the GP has to decide whether to share with social services and only if he/she shares those concerns. This suggestion goes completely against what we have in place now and should be resisted. Don't forget that once data has been shared, even if it was done illegally, it's practically impossible to repair the damage.

Comment 2: Generally speaking, I agree: our dealings with our GP should remain confidential unless we are specifically asked permission and give it. In the case of child protection concerns though, I feel the GP is given too much power. S/he might not ""share the concerns"" because s/he might be a poor reader of situations, s/he might well have fallen for the articulate charm of the abusing parent, etc. This is why we need a law on Mandatory Reporting; take it out of the ""Let's leave it to the GP's discretion"" category and put it in the ""If you don't report child abuse concerns to the authorities, you are guilty of a crime"" category. Given the chance to do nothing, a lot of people will do exactly that: nothing.  I do feel that's the exception. The idea of the police routinely accessing our medical records is repellant. To begin with, what makes them think that everything in our medical records is even accurate? I know that quite a lot of my own records, the parts of them concerning my mental health issues, are riddled with factual inaccuracies and nasty value judgements. And it is virtually impossible to get such ""info"" corrected or excised.

Comment 3: In the case of child protection concerns though, I feel the GP is given too much power. S/he might not ""share the concerns"" because s/he might be a poor reader of situations, s/he might well have fallen for the articulate charm of the abusing parent, etc. This is why we need a law on Mandatory Reporting; take it out of the ""Let's leave it to the GP's discretion"" category and put it in the ""If you don't report child abuse concerns to the authorities, you are guilty of a crime"" category. Given the chance to do nothing, a lot of people will do exactly that: nothing. You have to bear in mind that GPs are trained to the highest level (level 3) in child protection. Teachers are trained to level 1 and some of them to level 2. Ironically, the chance to do nothing is something most people, especially teachers, can't live with - they can't own the risk and need to pass the buck to social services, hence all the unnecessary referrals. It takes some balls to say ""I've been alerted to this issue but weighing up all the factors I don't think this warrants reporting to social services"". But you have to remember that legally, disclosing someone's information without good reason a.k.a. to be on the safe side, is as serious an offence as not disclosing something when you should have. It's a difficult balance but it's crucial to get things as accurate as possible as leaving someone with a social services record without justification and sharing someone's personal information without justification is potentially damaging to that individual and they can quite rightly seek redress and penalties for the individual who shared their data inappropriately. You can't go smearing people with a social services investigation 'just to be on the safe side'. It has to be justified on the balance of evidence and taking all factors into account. You can guarantee the 'just to be on the safe side' brigade have never been on the receiving end of an unjustified referral and have a record they shouldn't. Going back to your scenario, the GP (and anyone else speaking to social services) can and should only comment on what they know. If the GP has no concerns that is all he or she should say. Sharing medical information can only be done if the GP has concerns e.g. the child is often being brought in with bruises, doesn't look well etc and, to be frank, had this happened the GP would have raised the issue anyway. Same goes for teachers - they should advise they have no concerns if they have none based on what they know or choose to share if what social services are saying chimes with what they know of that child, based on facts, not opinion. What's needed is better training in child protection and the right sort of people in positions to make what are difficult decisions. As I said, it takes some balls to decide that a scenario doesn't need a referral and to stand by that decision. Presently we have situations where teachers didn't spot a child stealing food from bins and yet others getting all panicky when 11-12 year olds are using sexual language (quite normal of course).

Comment 4: The state have a terrible record of holding peoples' personal data securely as it stands. GPs are one exception - they are pretty good at holding data and NOT releasing it to anyone else without patient consent. Don't forget we are talking about <u>sensitive</u> personal data here. Also one of the Data Protection Act principles is that, to paraphrase, organisations should only have access to and hold personal data relevant to the task they need to undertake and it should not be excessing. This idea seems to go against that principle.

Comment 5: Although there is a power under s251 of the NHS Act 2006 for the Secretary of State to suspend the confidentiality of patient data and enable it to be disclosed where there is a medical benefit to the patient or it is too sensitive to make getting patient consent practicable. The proposal here sounds like one which could in theory be permitted by administrative action under that legislation.

Comment 6: <blockquote>  The state have a terrible record of holding peoples' personal data securely as it stands. GPs are one exception - they are pretty good at holding data and NOT releasing it to anyone else without patient consent. </blockquote>  Remember that last year there was the blatant attempt by the NHS to have everyone's records made accessible. Remember the lack of information given out, information given out at the last minute and the ""letters"" of their intentions and the obfuscated way of opting out not being delivered to households? There is an ongoing hidden agenda to make our medical records accessible to anyone willing to pay enough for the privilege. Everything will be a commodity unless we fight back.

27,The police should not have access to people's medical records.,"Main topic: The police should not have access to people's medical records.

Comment 1: Generally speaking, I agree: our dealings with our GP should remain confidential unless we are specifically asked permission and give it. In the case of child protection concerns though, I feel the GP is given too much power. S/he might not ""share the concerns"" because s/he might be a poor reader of situations, s/he might well have fallen for the articulate charm of the abusing parent, etc. This is why we need a law on Mandatory Reporting; take it out of the ""Let's leave it to the GP's discretion"" category and put it in the ""If you don't report child abuse concerns to the authorities, you are guilty of a crime"" category. Given the chance to do nothing, a lot of people will do exactly that: nothing.  I do feel that's the exception. The idea of the police routinely accessing our medical records is repellant. To begin with, what makes them think that everything in our medical records is even accurate? I know that quite a lot of my own records, the parts of them concerning my mental health issues, are riddled with factual inaccuracies and nasty value judgements. And it is virtually impossible to get such ""info"" corrected or excised.

Comment 2: In the case of child protection concerns though, I feel the GP is given too much power. S/he might not ""share the concerns"" because s/he might be a poor reader of situations, s/he might well have fallen for the articulate charm of the abusing parent, etc. This is why we need a law on Mandatory Reporting; take it out of the ""Let's leave it to the GP's discretion"" category and put it in the ""If you don't report child abuse concerns to the authorities, you are guilty of a crime"" category. Given the chance to do nothing, a lot of people will do exactly that: nothing. You have to bear in mind that GPs are trained to the highest level (level 3) in child protection. Teachers are trained to level 1 and some of them to level 2. Ironically, the chance to do nothing is something most people, especially teachers, can't live with - they can't own the risk and need to pass the buck to social services, hence all the unnecessary referrals. It takes some balls to say ""I've been alerted to this issue but weighing up all the factors I don't think this warrants reporting to social services"". But you have to remember that legally, disclosing someone's information without good reason a.k.a. to be on the safe side, is as serious an offence as not disclosing something when you should have. It's a difficult balance but it's crucial to get things as accurate as possible as leaving someone with a social services record without justification and sharing someone's personal information without justification is potentially damaging to that individual and they can quite rightly seek redress and penalties for the individual who shared their data inappropriately. You can't go smearing people with a social services investigation 'just to be on the safe side'. It has to be justified on the balance of evidence and taking all factors into account. You can guarantee the 'just to be on the safe side' brigade have never been on the receiving end of an unjustified referral and have a record they shouldn't. Going back to your scenario, the GP (and anyone else speaking to social services) can and should only comment on what they know. If the GP has no concerns that is all he or she should say. Sharing medical information can only be done if the GP has concerns e.g. the child is often being brought in with bruises, doesn't look well etc and, to be frank, had this happened the GP would have raised the issue anyway. Same goes for teachers - they should advise they have no concerns if they have none based on what they know or choose to share if what social services are saying chimes with what they know of that child, based on facts, not opinion. What's needed is better training in child protection and the right sort of people in positions to make what are difficult decisions.

Comment 3: There is nothing wrong with my genitals but I would object to the authorities having access to them without my consen.

Comment 4: Quite. I'm guessing though that Parliament would allow them only to view the records of the plebs. Politicos, their families and wider relatives, Royalty and ""personalities"" would be exempt. Know your place!

Comment 5: I can see how it would be useful if the police were aware that the person they'd just arrested for causing a disturbance wasn't drunk, but perhaps suffering some sort of medical condition or mental health issue. In which case locking them up for the night to 'sleep it off' wouldn't help, and might cause more harm than good. However, it's what the police actually do with that information that needs to be addressed. Surely we don't expect the police to be medical personnel and social workers as well as law enforcement? There needs to be greater interaction between social workers and medical services and the police. I would be in favour of not full access to all confidential records of everyone, but for some relevant information to be accessible in the case of people considered vulnerable. For example if a person was in need of regular medication etc.

Comment 6: I would hope that any person in need of regular medication would be wearing an appropriate medical alert bracelet/necklace. I certainly would if I had a medical condition that could cause me to appear to be drunk or even pass out in a public place. No need to give police additional powers, just make it compulsory to have this kind of notification device about your person.

Comment 7: <blockquote>  just make it compulsory to have this kind of notification device about your person. </blockquote>  Hard to enforce though. And what if not taking your meds makes you forget to put your bracelet on? Would you prefer to be tattooed with a barcode instead?

Comment 8: So what medications would you include in your compulsory display list? Insulin? Antidepressants? Antipsychotics?

Comment 9: <blockquote>  Investment is needed so police can be trained and specialists - who work with the police, but are not part of them - are immediately available to assess individuals to see who can be retained in custody and who needs to go to a specialist hospital. </blockquote>  That is the correct, but more expensive, approach. Giving untrained officers access to files intended for medical professionals can only end badly. I am sure that they wouldn't want doctors reading police intelligence reports and making decisions based on those reports. They would surely say that doctors don't have the experience and training to draw the correct deductions from the reports!

Comment 10: I'm going against the flow here but I can see at least one good reason for police having access to medical records. A particular incident when a close relative of mine went to the police and accused my partner and myself of physically abusing her as a child. She also accused us of deliberately starving our daughter.The police quite correctly had to act when she made these statement to them. They took her statement and began an investigation which resulted in a police visit to our home and interviewing me and my partner and even our 12 year old daughter. It was only when the police spoke to us that I was able to inform them that the allegations were impossible due to the time period and location that these incidents supposedly happened. But, most importantly, the police were unaware of our accusers mental health problems. She was being treated for schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. The accusations against us were only the latest of many bizarre accusations against others, including a local cafe she accused of poisoning her hot chocolate.I was amazed that the police had not checked the reliability of our accuser by accessing her medical records before setting in train an investigation that over months deeply upset and worried us, involved children's services and caused massive fall out within our family as a whole. But they told me they were unable to do that check on her, and would only have considered doing it, once the case had came to court and if our lawyer had asked for the information to be produced. One phone call to her GP could have prevented the whole fiasco if they had been allowed access to her records.

Comment 11: Yes and no. I fully understand your position as the equivalent happened to me (accused of assault, arrested by the Police as part of their investigation and then all dropped when they got the full facts). However just because someone has mental health issues does not mean that nothing happened. I would argue that the Police MUST investigate any and every accusation. Tricky, very tricky but I can see it from their point of view. At the end of the day who will be blamed if something goes wrong - them!

Comment 12: This sounds like a horrible situation but it doesn't give anyone the right to access someone's medical records without their consent. Regardless of other considerations, your medical history is your own and should be private.

Comment 13: I am afraid that you have badly misjudged the point. Even if they DID know your accuser's mental problems, and mental history, they would still have carried on regardless. Indeed, you'll find lots of Guardian articles suggesting that they SHOULD do so. Whether or not they were able to access her records would not have made a blind bit of difference.

Comment 14: Well, as I stated:  <blockquote>  The police quite correctly had to act </blockquote>  But surely they should have had the full information about the accuser when acting in such an accusation?As it turned out the police were quite miffed when they discovered they had spent so much time and effort on a case that could easily have been spotted as bogus if they'd had the medical info. They even asked me if I wished to make a complaint against my accuser, as they were now considering charging her with wasting police time. I declined as I felt they just wanted a conviction, one way or another, to justify their investigation.

Comment 15: An interesting case. But it borders on proposing the idea that mentally ill people are all liars who can't be trusted. And its just a tad more complex than that. PS I'm someone who has had mental health issues in life. I don't like the suggestion that if I ever accuse anyone of anything my mental health will be used as something to count against the veracity, or not, of anything I might have to say.

Comment 16: But this is very revealing, isn't it, of what might happen if the police discover someone they're dealing with has a mental health problem. Not only, as RonRafferty has pointed out, should someone with a metal health problem be listened to regardless but, also, the response of the police in this case, was to suggest prosecuting the person for waiting police time. No suggestion of wanting to act as mental health professionals here. Just more of this, presumably: http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-statistics/prisons/

Comment 17: Phoning the GP and asking about the person's background could well have helped though. It would have given them a clearer picture. I do accept that all allegations have to be investigated, nonetheless: plenty of people with mental health issues (and diagnoses) have been abused as children.  I think there's a big difference between speaking over the phone to someone's GP and actually wading through someone's medical files. Lisalane, I'm rather taken aback that you were surprised that the police ""even"" wanted to speak to your daughter. Given that the allegation mentioned her and possible abuse, of course they would want to speak to her privately; taking the word of the parents only in this scenario would be a failure to do their job.

Comment 18: Look, I can think of lots of situations where it might be helpful to the police to be able to access someone's medical records. That's not at issue. Obviously it can be helpful. The issue is whether the police have a right to it. Medical information is about the most sensitive personal information there is. It is parted with on the basis that it is completely private and it should remain so.

Comment 19: I've remarked on this case before, but I'll pass it on again. A woman accused her doctor (same practice as our's but not our doctor) of sexual assault. It was widely known in the local area that she had done the same thing several times before with various other men in the district, but the case churned on for well over a year with regular newspaper updates re the Dr, his suspension, and the allegations. The woman of course was not mentioned by name (though it being a country area, her name was widely known. After about 18 months, the case was dropped, the doctor returned to work, and the slate supposedly wiped clean.

Comment 20: <blockquote>  But surely they should have had the full information about the accuser when acting in such an accusation? </blockquote>  You're suggesting that they should not have investigated, if they had known that this person had a history of mental illness. Sorry but that's just another argument against this plan - these people are already some of the most vulnerable and preyed upon in our society. What you're suggesting is that they effectively have a flag against their name so that if they ever make a complaint it gets ignored because of their condition - suddenly open season on people with mental illness as people know that their complaints will never be investigated. Then we get on to the other half of your horrendous suggestion - if you ever report a crime to the police, they'll dig through your medical records to 'judge your character'. What a massive incentive to report crimes, not only do you get to do your civic duty, but police will dig through your medical records as an added perk!

Comment 21: Interesting point, but surely if the police were actually doing their own job properly they would have had access to their own records of the number of false complaints raised by this person. No need to access the medical records, just make sure the police records are complete and accessible.

Comment 22: <blockquote>  You're suggesting that they should not have investigated, if they had known that this person had a history of mental illness. </blockquote>  No, that would be wrong. Please don't put words in my mouth for a cheap comment.I'm suggesting that if the police knew she had a history of making wild unfounded accusations against people it would have informed them of the possible nature of THIS accusation.

Comment 23: <blockquote>  Please don't put words in my mouth for a cheap comment. </blockquote>No-one's putting words in your mouth. You wrote:  <blockquote>  I was amazed that the police had not checked the reliability of our accuser by accessing her medical records </blockquote> and <blockquote>  ... a case that could easily have been spotted as bogus if they'd had the medical info. </blockquote>You are suggesting that her history of mental illness means her accusations are automaticlly false.   <blockquote>  The accusations against us were only the latest of many bizarre accusations against others </blockquote>Right, then the police will have a record of this. This is the record they should have been checking - her medical records have nothing to do with it.  I wouldn't be surprised if this person did have some kind of serious abuse in their past, hence it coming out in this weird way of wild accusations (it would not be the first time). I can't imagine the hell of having schizophrenia and BPD together. People diagnosed BPD are very likely to have been abused and are generally abused again by the system - it's known as a 'dustbin diagnosis' and seen as ok to neglect or bully people with that diagnosis. So, so cruel, considering people with BPD have an incredibly low tolerance to emotional pain.  I write this as your whole post stinks of ""oh, i'm a normal person and this horrible mental person made it so hrd for me!"" - she's been through/is going through hell every day.

Comment 24: <blockquote>  ""A schizophrenic man was shot dead in the street by a police marksman after he refused to drop a samurai sword, an inquest has heard. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4052267.stm""    This is sadly what can happen when the police become involved with the vulnerable  </blockquote>  Moreover what difference would it have made had the police access to his records? They would known that he suffered from schizophrenia but they would still have shot him if he threatened officers or the public.

Comment 25: This is absurd and dangerous on so many levels. Firstly, the police do not have the competence to read and use medical records. They are written for the benefit of clinicians, medically untrained police officers.  Second, and most important of all, medical records are highly confidential, and the information in them was disclosed on the strict understanding that it would not be handed out willynilly to anyone who thinks they should see it. It is matter of basic medical ethics. Medical records should be made available only if the patient approves it or in receipt of a court order. Third, I cannot imagine a worst custodian of sensitive medical information than the police. They have no credibility. Undoubtedly such information would be leaked by unscrupulous officers to newspapers and also used to discredit anyone who makes a complaint against the police. We are dealing here with an organization that thought it was acceptable to spy in the Lawrence family to protect the police service, not for any legitimate law-enforcement reason. No, no, no, no, no.

Comment 26: Undoubtedly such information would be leaked by unscrupulous officers to newspapers and also used to discredit anyone who makes a complaint against the police. Exactly - it would be easy to discredit a politician if medical records show he had an STD at 15 or she had an abortion while still at school and that kind of damage can't be undone.

Comment 1: <blockquote>  The problem is helping the vulnerable has become crisis management. But the solution is to take the police out of the matrix as far as possible, not to draw them in to this absurd and counterproductive extent. </blockquote>  The police are on call 24/7; and at 3am when there's nobody else to take charge of vulnerable adults or children, they have no choice but to do their best. That usuallly involves ringing a duty social worker who can do eff all, or maybe the local council to rehouse someone who's got nowhere else to go, and they're not always able to do so.  In my view, Deborah is slightly contradicting herself in this article; <blockquote>  It's a good thing the police now recognise that the majority of the people who come to their attention are vulnerable and find it hard to do what's best for themselves, let alone what's best for those around them. </blockquote>  And then; <blockquote>  However, far from being an indication that the police need more power, it's a sign that they are now straying too far from their remit, which is to maintain law and order. Fahy himself talks of having an ability ""to solve the problem without a criminal justice system approach"". </blockquote>  The Police can't maintain law and order when the disorder is caused by people with mental health issues; except by locking them in a cell. It might be that we should have less police and more social workers, but I suspect thats going to be a hard idea to sell to the public. In the meantime; if we're going to use the police as social workers and mental health nurses; lets give them the tools to do the job.

Comment 2: <blockquote>  if we're going to use the police as social workers and mental health nurses; lets give them the tools to do the job. </blockquote>  How will giving them access to medical records that they will not understand give them the tools to the job? It will likely make things worse by causing them to over-react and use disproportionate force if they see something in the report that they do not like the look of.

Comment 3: '...Locking them in a police cell.' Is that so PC Plod can go there later, to kill the ill person? Quite often, it seems.

Comment 4: <blockquote>  Is that so PC Plod can go there later, to kill the ill person? Quite often, it seems </blockquote>  As I was saying; the police have to deal with a llot of mentally ill people....

Perhaps they could be trained as lawyers, that would save a lot of problems. I'm pretty sure that your average policeman is a polymath just waiting for his/her latent talent to be unleashed (purely for the benefit of society) and just needs the tools to get on with it. Why do we need all these specialists when the police can do it all? After all, there are no cases where the police have misused and abused the powers and tools they already have, we can trust them to do the right thing.

Comment 11: I agree. The police are in an impossible position here because they're the ones who are the first point of contact for mentally ill people when an incident occurs, and they're the ones who get it in the neck if something goes wrong, because they aren't trained to deal with them.

Comment 13: <blockquote>  The Greater Manchester chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, has told the Guardian the police want quick and easy access to medical and other confidential records without the consent of the individual concerned. In the light of other recent revelations about state incursion into private data, one is tempted to note that it's nice of them to ask. </blockquote> Thanks for the clear put down of this mad, bad and dangerous idea. I think that it should raise big questions about Sir Peter Fahy's competence.  Leaving aside any ulterior motives the police might have for this, such as smearing whistleblowers, something they apparently have a long history of - it is just ill thought out. It could only ever be used in a very arbitrary and piecemeal way. If the police think they have the resources to replace the NHS, the Social Services and other support agencies, then either they have got far more resources than they need, or they've simply lost the plot. This is not joined up thinking, it is completely the opposite. It is a type of thinking whereby someone has just made themselves willfully blind of all the contradictions. It also make you wonder if the police are considering a future dystopia where they foresee there will be lots of vulnerable people abandoned by the system. In which case they would be far better to criticise the cuts to essential services, and the situation its creating. This is far more within their remit. Finally this illustrates a very worrying Messiah Complex of senior police officers. The sign of a competent professional is a realistic appraisal of their capabilities. What makes the police think they are even competent to understand people's medical records? This fact alone says that senior police officers are choked with hubris, and need to be made far more publicly accountable for their actions. Plus it is very questionable as to whether supposed public servants should be speaking out on matters of policy, other than to highlight problems.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_complex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_complex</a> What next, will Sir Peter Fahy be asking for the right of the police to intervene in international situations. Maybe he could go and sort out the problems in Iraq, Syria, Gaza etc, whilst he's at it. Or maybe the police could be funded to develop a cure for cancer. Or perhaps like his predecessor James Anderton, he has got a personal hotline to god.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderton</a> It is very telling that the former Chief Constable of Manchester James Anderton also had a close personal relationship (as well as god) with Cyril Smith.

Comment 14: The police are in a no win situation here - they can't look at medical records because it is alleged they can't be trusted and yet at the same time they're expected to diagnose a myriad of health problems and react accordingly.

Comment 15: Surely it's not the case that the police are expected to 'diagnose a myriad of health problems and react accordingly'? They're expected to follow up reports and disturbances and then pass on cases for appropriate further action. They are specifically not supposed to act on any prejudices they might have, about mental illness or anything else, though of course anyone could be excused for thinking this sort of even-handedness doesn't always happen.

Comment 16: Unless the officers are medically trained, access to medical records will render them no more able to react accordingly. It will simply waste time before they either have to take a chance anyway, or contact a medical professional. And that isn't a statement about police officers. It is a statement about anybody with no medical training.

Comment 17: What evidence is there of acting on prejudices?

Comment 18: <blockquote>  What evidence is there of acting on prejudices? </blockquote>  Since there is widespread prejudice against mental illness in our society, surely you should be asking if there is any evidence that the police are not affected by this prejudice?

Comment 19: What evidence is there of acting on prejudices? Research on policing conducted in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s indicated that racism and racial prejudice in police culture were more widespread and more extreme than in wider society. Studies found that 'racial prejudice and racialist talk . . . [were] pervasive . . . expected, accepted and even fashionable' (Smith and Gray 1985: 388-9) while negative views of people from ethnic minorities and support for extreme right political parties were widespread (Smith and Gray 1985; Holdaway 1983, 1997: 78; Reiner 2000: 98-100, 115-21).Research evidence over the past three decades has found that specific stereotypes are commonly used by police officers to classify people on the basis of their ethnic origin. Studies found that Asians tended to be regarded as devious, liars and potential illegal immigrants (Cain 1973; Graef 1989: 131; Jefferson 1993). The pliability of stereotypes of Asian and particularly Muslim people has been documented in recent research, which has suggested that perceptions of Asian and particularly Muslim people have undergone a transformation. Stereotypes, which assumed that Asian people were conformist, are now thought to be less applicable and rather, the very stereotypes assumed to explain law-abiding behaviour (e.g. family pressures, tight knit communities and high levels of social control) are now thought to promote criminal and deviant activity amongst Asian youth (Hudson and Bramhall 2005; Hudson 2007; Parmar 2007). The shift in the perception of such groups has been located in both local and global notions of Asian youth as increasingly involved in gangs, violent, disorderly, riotous and, more recently, as potential terrorists (Webster 1997; Alexander 2000; Goodey 2001).Stereotypes of black people have been more consistent in that they are thought to be more prone to violent crime and drug abuse, to be incomprehensible, suspicious, hard to handle, naturally excitable, aggressive, lacking brainpower, troublesome and 'tooled up' (Graef 1989; Reiner 1991). These findings have not been restricted to constables but have been found throughout the ranks (see Reiner 1991: 44). A 1997 inspection of community and race relations policies and practices within the police service conducted by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary concluded that 'racial discrimination, both direct and indirect, and harassment are endemic within our society and the police service is no exception . . .' and that there was 'a direct and vital link between internal culture in the way people are treated and external performance' (HMIC 1997: 18). On the basis of the inspection and accounts of racist behaviour by police officers from members of the public, HMIC concluded that even 'if the majority of the accounts are dismissed as either the products of third party articulation or even exaggeration, a picture still emerges of pockets of wholly unacceptable racist policing' (1997: 18).

29,The police should be given access to medical records.,"Main topic: The police should be given access to medical records.

Comment 1: I am afraid that you have badly misjudged the point. Even if they DID know your accuser's mental problems, and mental history, they would still have carried on regardless. Indeed, you'll find lots of Guardian articles suggesting that they SHOULD do so. Whether or not they were able to access her records would not have made a blind bit of difference.

Comment 2: Well, as I stated:  <blockquote>  The police quite correctly had to act </blockquote>  But surely they should have had the full information about the accuser when acting in such an accusation?As it turned out the police were quite miffed when they discovered they had spent so much time and effort on a case that could easily have been spotted as bogus if they'd had the medical info. They even asked me if I wished to make a complaint against my accuser, as they were now considering charging her with wasting police time. I declined as I felt they just wanted a conviction, one way or another, to justify their investigation.

Comment 3: An interesting case. But it borders on proposing the idea that mentally ill people are all liars who can't be trusted. And its just a tad more complex than that. PS I'm someone who has had mental health issues in life. I don't like the suggestion that if I ever accuse anyone of anything my mental health will be used as something to count against the veracity, or not, of anything I might have to say.

Comment 4: But this is very revealing, isn't it, of what might happen if the police discover someone they're dealing with has a mental health problem. Not only, as RonRafferty has pointed out, should someone with a metal health problem be listened to regardless but, also, the response of the police in this case, was to suggest prosecuting the person for waiting police time. No suggestion of wanting to act as mental health professionals here. Just more of this, presumably: http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-statistics/prisons/

Comment 5: I've remarked on this case before, but I'll pass it on again. A woman accused her doctor (same practice as our's but not our doctor) of sexual assault. It was widely known in the local area that she had done the same thing several times before with various other men in the district, but the case churned on for well over a year with regular newspaper updates re the Dr, his suspension, and the allegations. The woman of course was not mentioned by name (though it being a country area, her name was widely known. After about 18 months, the case was dropped, the doctor returned to work, and the slate supposedly wiped clean.

Comment 6: <blockquote>  But surely they should have had the full information about the accuser when acting in such an accusation? </blockquote>  You're suggesting that they should not have investigated, if they had known that this person had a history of mental illness. Sorry but that's just another argument against this plan - these people are already some of the most vulnerable and preyed upon in our society. What you're suggesting is that they effectively have a flag against their name so that if they ever make a complaint it gets ignored because of their condition - suddenly open season on people with mental illness as people know that their complaints will never be investigated. Then we get on to the other half of your horrendous suggestion - if you ever report a crime to the police, they'll dig through your medical records to 'judge your character'. What a massive incentive to report crimes, not only do you get to do your civic duty, but police will dig through your medical records as an added perk!

Comment 7: <blockquote>  You're suggesting that they should not have investigated, if they had known that this person had a history of mental illness. </blockquote>  No, that would be wrong. Please don't put words in my mouth for a cheap comment.I'm suggesting that if the police knew she had a history of making wild unfounded accusations against people it would have informed them of the possible nature of THIS accusation.

Comment 8: <blockquote>  Please don't put words in my mouth for a cheap comment. </blockquote>No-one's putting words in your mouth. You wrote:  <blockquote>  I was amazed that the police had not checked the reliability of our accuser by accessing her medical records </blockquote> and <blockquote>  ... a case that could easily have been spotted as bogus if they'd had the medical info. </blockquote>You are suggesting that her history of mental illness means her accusations are automaticlly false.   <blockquote>  The accusations against us were only the latest of many bizarre accusations against others </blockquote>Right, then the police will have a record of this. This is the record they should have been checking - her medical records have nothing to do with it.  I wouldn't be surprised if this person did have some kind of serious abuse in their past, hence it coming out in this weird way of wild accusations (it would not be the first time). I can't imagine the hell of having schizophrenia and BPD together. People diagnosed BPD are very likely to have been abused and are generally abused again by the system - it's known as a 'dustbin diagnosis' and seen as ok to neglect or bully people with that diagnosis. So, so cruel, considering people with BPD have an incredibly low tolerance to emotional pain.  I write this as your whole post stinks of ""oh, i'm a normal person and this horrible mental person made it so hrd for me!"" - she's been through/is going through hell every day.

Comment 9: My brother in law has a number of mental health issues including paranoid schizophrenia. Fifteen or twenty years ago when he first started receiving treatment there was a local crisis team made up of experienced mental health nurses operating county-wide 24/7. Typical response times were measured in minutes rather than hours or days. Now when he has an 'episode' the police are deployed as a first response. Mental health professionals only attend hours, sometimes days later to make a brief visit/assessment (depending on whether an arrest has been made). This is, in part, due to the crisis teams having been cut back massively (24/7 cover is expensive to maintain, especially when there are sometimes no call outs to justify the expense) and those experienced nurses who have retired have not been replaced. He was rarely violent when the nurses he knew and trusted were on the response team, but now with any 20 year old copper being deployed without knowing the details can be very distressing for everyone involved. The shocking state of mental health care provision is partly to blame - but mental healthcare beds are being cut everywhere without there being adequate support for sufferers living in the community. There's only so much family support that can be offered when everyone has to go out and earn a living.

Comment 10: A couple of years ago I saw a young woman being dragged along the pavement by a man who had her in a head lock at 10.30pm. To keep it short, I told him to let her go, which he did and then he attacked me, punching me. Another passerby called the Police. When they arrived I showed them my injuries, already massive bruising appearing on my arms where I was punched. (I'm on blood thinners for a heart condition so bruise easily). However, on learning that I have mental health problems I was immediately surrounded by 8 PCs, identified as the cause of the problem and threatened with arrest. When I asked which Officer was in charge one sarcastically told me ""no-one"" which is clearly a lie. The bloke who assaulted me was sent on his way and a short time later I was too. This is how the Police treat the vulnerable when they have medical information on them.

Comment 11: PS I put in a formal complaint and was thanked by the local Inspector for doing so he was able to ensure that the bloke who assaulted me was dealt with properly, as nothing would have been followed up on. As for the Officer who lied to me? He was unable to identify who it was as it was ""an exceptionally busy night"". That is, the 8 PCs present closed ranks and acted dumb/lied. Fuckers!

Comment 12: PPS There was also a comment from one of the PCs present at the time that it was a ""domestic"" and I shouldn't have got involved, which suggests to me the Fahy needs to do a lot of educating round the country to get Officers to take domestic violence seriously.

Comment 13: And this is why anyone with even the slightest history of any mental health problems in life (a vast range of conditions from very mild to completely debilitating) will tremble at the thought that the Police can call up such details, make their own (probably unwarranted) assumptions and act accordingly. The Police are corrupt enough as it is. We do not need them deciding that ""mentals"" are the problem which I don't doubt they already do.

Comment 14: You've just succinctly shown why the police should not be given access to records. They are woefully undereducated about mental health issues just as they are woefully undereducated about domestic violence.  They are also, may I say, woefully undereducated about learning disability. My 15-year-son, who has severe learning disability and autism and who will never be independent (due to having no sense of danger either from traffic or from people), went AWOL one sunny afternoon. I called the police. When he had strolled back of his own accord, the police came round to the house and seemed completely unable to understand why he couldn't give a full account of where he had been and what he had been doing. (He has the speech of maybe a 3-year-old, and little or no understanding of why other people might be worried.) Throughout the whole incident I had been telling them that he has little sense of danger, that he is fully-able bodied but limited intellectually. . .they behaved as if they had never encountered such a person before! The police woman on the other end of the line repeatedly used the term ""mental health issues.""  The police don't need more powers. They need more education about human beings.

Comment 15: I have heard serving police officers seriously questioning whether or not under-25s actually had human rights. Please, please don't give these people my medical records - they're far too stupid, arrogant and aggresive to be trusted with such things.

They would known that he suffered from schizophrenia but they would still have shot him if he threatened officers or the public.

Comment 21: And don't forget that a blind man with a white stick was tasered!

Comment 22: It is worse than you suggest. If a suspected criminal is held in custody in a Police cell that custody must be reviewed at least once every 24 hours. If a suspected mentally ill person is held in a Police cell as a ""place of safety"" under Section 135 and 136 that custody only needs to be reviewed every 72 hours. Or, the Law says that a suspected criminal is treated with 3 times more consideration/human rights than a suspected nutter.

Comment 23: I had no idea that mental health users in custody do not actually have the same rights. When the police, I assume with no medical advice can make those decisions it won't be long before a trail of miscarriages of justice emerges. The media constantly portray mentally ill people as violent and unpredictable and so why on earth would the police have an ""educated"" informed view.

Comment 24: You were doing so well ...  <blockquote>  nutter </blockquote>  is completely unacceptable. It is a pejorative, an deeply unpleasant way to describe someone with possible mental health issues.

Comment 25: Have you not heard of police surgeons? The police do need a qualified medical practitioner's input when detainees are believed to be unwell. Do you really think that custody officers want to keep people in custody for 72 hours because its good fun? I despair.

Comment 26: I was once kept in custody overnight (admittedly not 72 hours) when I should have been taken to hospital, and taken to court the next morning only for the court to shout at the Police, ""Why isn't this man in hospital?"". PS I won't go into too much detail as it is a litany of failure and deliberate neglect. It was later found that I hadn't done anything wrong in the first place - I was severely mentally unwell and spent the next 3 months in hospital - and it was acknowledged that I should have been taken to hospital straight away - I have a 49 page apology saying so. The duty Inspector responsible for my welfare overnight did say to me that ""people like you need to be taught a lesson"" but I couldn't prove it. ""People like me"" - the mentally ill. The custody Sergeant responsible was ""allowed"" to resign whilst the investigation into my complaint was ongoing; the usual behaviour. Did they do this because it was fun? I dunno, but they certainly did it 'cos they could. The joys of being a ""nutter"".

Comment 27: The use of the word ""nutter"" was deliberate. I used the pejorative to emphasise how Society in general, but especially law enforcement in all it's forms, treats/views the mentally ill and disabled. Sometimes you have to hit bigots/bigoted systems between the eyes with their own prejudice. Admittedly it might have helped if I wrapped the words in parentheses... PS I have 4 mental health diagnoses and am classified as both mentally ill and disabled, so am talking about my people.

Comment 28: I despair you appear to be suggesting ""police surgeons"" are qualified to make decisions involving mental illness that then can imprison innocent vulnerable patients for up to 72 hours in a police cell.

30,The police should be given access to medical records.,"Main topic: The police should be given access to medical records.

Comment 1: Given the opportinity, the police would have a camera on everyone, and you'd have to have their permission to breathe in and out. Neither this, nor loads of other things are any of their fucking business. They are here to guarantee a free society. That means free from their interference as much as anything else

Comment 2: But if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't be scared. No innocent person has ever suffered from police injustice *wibbles*

Comment 3: Quite right, how silly of me! I shall therefore give them a sample of my DNA, a fully itemised list of where I intend to travel, who I am travelling with, my car registration, everything I do on the computer, a copy of every letter, parcel and card I send through the post, the name of everyone I have ever known, every shop I have been in, my credit card number and code, and hand in my bank accounts for regular scrutiny. Oh, but they have almost all of that already ................. Except (to the best of my knowledge) my DNA. But should I be caught parking illegally, then I'm sure there's a case for them to collect that too.

Comment 4: That's not true. They damn well wouldn't have a camera on themselves.

Comment 5: Oh, I don't know. It could go wrong at crucial moments. Purely by technical coincidence, naturally.

Comment 6: The suspect then headbutted the camera 17 times, causing criminal damage?

Comment 7: Sounds (im)plausible M'Lud!

Comment 8: On top of Ron's points I'd add that the police have a poor understanding of Data Protection Act rules i.e. what they can share with which organisations with/without consent. GP's are pretty good at this. Even when they share personal data with a hospital consultant as part of a referral they obtain the patient's consent. Conversely, Social Workers regularly phone up my GP wife asking for patient medical details - she says ""Fine - just fax me through the patient consent"" and that's the last she hears of it. Whether they are actually ignorant of the law or just trying it on, I don't know. Your medical records are between you and your GP and nobody has access to them without your consent. There are one or two exceptions, child protection but even then the GP has to decide whether to share with social services and only if he/she shares those concerns. This suggestion goes completely against what we have in place now and should be resisted. Don't forget that once data has been shared, even if it was done illegally, it's practically impossible to repair the damage.

Comment 9: Generally speaking, I agree: our dealings with our GP should remain confidential unless we are specifically asked permission and give it. In the case of child protection concerns though, I feel the GP is given too much power. S/he might not ""share the concerns"" because s/he might be a poor reader of situations, s/he might well have fallen for the articulate charm of the abusing parent, etc. This is why we need a law on Mandatory Reporting; take it out of the ""Let's leave it to the GP's discretion"" category and put it in the ""If you don't report child abuse concerns to the authorities, you are guilty of a crime"" category. Given the chance to do nothing, a lot of people will do exactly that: nothing.  I do feel that's the exception. The idea of the police routinely accessing our medical records is repellant. To begin with, what makes them think that everything in our medical records is even accurate? I know that quite a lot of my own records, the parts of them concerning my mental health issues, are riddled with factual inaccuracies and nasty value judgements. And it is virtually impossible to get such ""info"" corrected or excised.

Comment 10: Aren't the police trialling having cameras on themselves to record all interactions with the public?

Comment 11: The police need to learn that claiming that it will help them catch 'paedos and terrorists' will help them get whatever intrusive permissions they need. Or is that excuse reserved for central government?

Comment 12: In the case of child protection concerns though, I feel the GP is given too much power. S/he might not ""share the concerns"" because s/he might be a poor reader of situations, s/he might well have fallen for the articulate charm of the abusing parent, etc. This is why we need a law on Mandatory Reporting; take it out of the ""Let's leave it to the GP's discretion"" category and put it in the ""If you don't report child abuse concerns to the authorities, you are guilty of a crime"" category. Given the chance to do nothing, a lot of people will do exactly that: nothing. You have to bear in mind that GPs are trained to the highest level (level 3) in child protection. Teachers are trained to level 1 and some of them to level 2. Ironically, the chance to do nothing is something most people, especially teachers, can't live with - they can't own the risk and need to pass the buck to social services, hence all the unnecessary referrals. It takes some balls to say ""I've been alerted to this issue but weighing up all the factors I don't think this warrants reporting to social services"". But you have to remember that legally, disclosing someone's information without good reason a.k.a. to be on the safe side, is as serious an offence as not disclosing something when you should have. It's a difficult balance but it's crucial to get things as accurate as possible as leaving someone with a social services record without justification and sharing someone's personal information without justification is potentially damaging to that individual and they can quite rightly seek redress and penalties for the individual who shared their data inappropriately. You can't go smearing people with a social services investigation 'just to be on the safe side'. It has to be justified on the balance of evidence and taking all factors into account. You can guarantee the 'just to be on the safe side' brigade have never been on the receiving end of an unjustified referral and have a record they shouldn't. Going back to your scenario, the GP (and anyone else speaking to social services) can and should only comment on what they know. If the GP has no concerns that is all he or she should say. Sharing medical information can only be done if the GP has concerns e.g. the child is often being brought in with bruises, doesn't look well etc and, to be frank, had this happened the GP would have raised the issue anyway. Same goes for teachers - they should advise they have no concerns if they have none based on what they know or choose to share if what social services are saying chimes with what they know of that child, based on facts, not opinion. What's needed is better training in child protection and the right sort of people in positions to make what are difficult decisions. As I said, it takes some balls to decide that a scenario doesn't need a referral and to stand by that decision. Presently we have situations where teachers didn't spot a child stealing food from bins and yet others getting all panicky when 11-12 year olds are using sexual language (quite normal of course).

Comment 13: Yes I think they are. And hopefully, joking about camera malfunctions aside, it will prove useful.

Comment 14: The Police? Nope its the state that wants to control everything. Leftist statist nonsense abounds. Pre crime Pre distribution Pre taxation It's all about the state screwing the public and the left are cheering it on.

Comment 16: There's one effect. Currently the state is filming us.  What happens when the cameras are turned? Bad policing - easy - sack the cops.  Lack of policing? Very difficult. Its policy. Same applies to the NHS. Film neglect and chaos, and its exposed. Difficultly arises when its policy. Record your conversations with the tax man. Can I claim for X? Yes. Claim for it. If they dispute it, its out with the tape. Tell your mates too. Same for companies. Divorce. Here's the mix tape of my spouse's behaviour.  .... I think the state has more to lose from the cameras being turned.

Comment 17: There is nothing wrong with my genitals but I would object to the authorities having access to them without my consen.

Comment 18: Given the ease with which the late News of the World was able to illegally obtain information from police officers, this would not end well.

Comment 19: Quite. I'm guessing though that Parliament would allow them only to view the records of the plebs. Politicos, their families and wider relatives, Royalty and ""personalities"" would be exempt. Know your place!

Comment 20: As it seems we can't trust the police, it's probably a bad idea to grant them even more access to personal information about individuals. If I were a vulnerable person who had been a victim of crime, knowing the police could access my medical records without my consent would probably dissuade me from coming forward.

Comment 21: I have heard serving police officers seriously questioning whether or not under-25s actually had human rights. Please, please don't give these people my medical records - they're far too stupid, arrogant and aggresive to be trusted with such things.

Comment 22: What evidence is there of acting on prejudices? Research on policing conducted in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s indicated that racism and racial prejudice in police culture were more widespread and more extreme than in wider society. Studies found that 'racial prejudice and racialist talk . . . [were] pervasive . . . expected, accepted and even fashionable' (Smith and Gray 1985: 388-9) while negative views of people from ethnic minorities and support for extreme right political parties were widespread (Smith and Gray 1985; Holdaway 1983, 1997: 78; Reiner 2000: 98-100, 115-21).Research evidence over the past three decades has found that specific stereotypes are commonly used by police officers to classify people on the basis of their ethnic origin. Studies found that Asians tended to be regarded as devious, liars and potential illegal immigrants (Cain 1973; Graef 1989: 131; Jefferson 1993). The pliability of stereotypes of Asian and particularly Muslim people has been documented in recent research, which has suggested that perceptions of Asian and particularly Muslim people have undergone a transformation. Stereotypes, which assumed that Asian people were conformist, are now thought to be less applicable and rather, the very stereotypes assumed to explain law-abiding behaviour (e.g. family pressures, tight knit communities and high levels of social control) are now thought to promote criminal and deviant activity amongst Asian youth (Hudson and Bramhall 2005; Hudson 2007; Parmar 2007). The shift in the perception of such groups has been located in both local and global notions of Asian youth as increasingly involved in gangs, violent, disorderly, riotous and, more recently, as potential terrorists (Webster 1997; Alexander 2000; Goodey 2001).Stereotypes of black people have been more consistent in that they are thought to be more prone to violent crime and drug abuse, to be incomprehensible, suspicious, hard to handle, naturally excitable, aggressive, lacking brainpower, troublesome and 'tooled up' (Graef 1989; Reiner 1991). These findings have not been restricted to constables but have been found throughout the ranks (see Reiner 1991: 44). A 1997 inspection of community and race relations policies and practices within the police service conducted by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary concluded that 'racial discrimination, both direct and indirect, and harassment are endemic within our society and the police service is no exception . . .' and that there was 'a direct and vital link between internal culture in the way people are treated and external performance' (HMIC 1997: 18). On the basis of the inspection and accounts of racist behaviour by police officers from members of the public, HMIC concluded that even 'if the majority of the accounts are dismissed as either the products of third party articulation or even exaggeration, a picture still emerges of pockets of wholly unacceptable racist policing' (1997: 18).

Comment 23: I can see a return to the days when the police wrote the criminals confession (because he can't write m'lud) and a police officer's word is sufficient. He confessed in the back of the car m'lud, no m'lud I was on my own, the black eye, broken nose and missing teeth, m'lud? Don't know anything about that m'lud, he must have had an accident and fallen down the stairs m'lud.

Comment 24: Police powers should not be getting ever wider and wider. They should be being restricted. They have clearly and repeatedly been shown to be corrupt and totally untrustworthy. Allowing confidential records into their hands on a regularly basis would be madness. I despair the idea is even mooted.

Comment 25: This is absurd and dangerous on so many levels. Firstly, the police do not have the competence to read and use medical records. They are written for the benefit of clinicians, medically untrained police officers.  Second, and most important of all, medical records are highly confidential, and the information in them was disclosed on the strict understanding that it would not be handed out willynilly to anyone who thinks they should see it. It is matter of basic medical ethics. Medical records should be made available only if the patient approves it or in receipt of a court order. Third, I cannot imagine a worst custodian of sensitive medical information than the police. They have no credibility. Undoubtedly such information would be leaked by unscrupulous officers to newspapers and also used to discredit anyone who makes a complaint against the police. We are dealing here with an organization that thought it was acceptable to spy in the Lawrence family to protect the police service, not for any legitimate law-enforcement reason. No, no, no, no, no.

Comment 26: Undoubtedly such information would be leaked by unscrupulous officers to newspapers and also used to discredit anyone who makes a complaint against the police. Exactly - it would be easy to discredit a politician if medical records show he had an STD at 15 or she had an abortion while still at school and that kind of damage can't be undone.

Comment 29: If a less benevolent successor to Mr Fahy were to have access to medical records, what's to stop them from operating a ""pre-crime"" initiative to identify people with mental health diagnoses that may include violent tendencies? Never mind that they are statistically more likely to harm themselves or be harmed by others than they are to commit harm to others.

Comment 30: Good point, Pagey. I recall the police wrote in advance to potential demonstrators ""suggesting"" that they do not attend a march. That could easily be regarded as a ""pre-crime"" initiative.

Comment 31: Jesus. I'm stunned by this. I can't work out after reading Deborah's article though what they actually want it for though. What does 'solving a problem without the use of the criminal justice system' mean exactly? They're the police. Criminal Justice is their remit isn't it? What are they going to do, start handing out plasters? Provide counselling session? Oh, hang on! A chill wind has just blown through my soul. I don't like the sound of this at all. The police aren't doctors and they shouldn't try to be. Some information is private. Not because it masks criminal activity but because people essentially like only people they trust knowing things about them. People whose job is to catch criminals going through personal records about someone's nervous breakdown or miscarriage or whatever isn't going to make people feel good about going to their doctor. That self-evident isn't it? This - unless some brilliant, non-PR speak response is forthcoming - is dangerous stuff. I just wish I knew what it was all in aid of. What do the police want?

34,Strong border controls are required to prevent diseases from entering the UK.,"Main topic: Strong border controls are required to prevent diseases from entering the UK.

Comment 1: <blockquote>  Britain's only priority should be making sure that this disease does not make it to the UK. Once again the need to far stronger border controls is demonstrated. </blockquote>  I find it quote sickening the way that any opportunity to inject anti-immigration rhetoric into a thread, whatever the topic.  Britain's best strategy for protecting itself from ebola is to give health care support to the afflicted countries. It may surprise you that viruses don't share your prejudice and will take the opportunity to infect any traveler, whatever their status. In addition, we might just consider helping out of humanitarian concern for others regardless of any self interest.

Comment 2: What on earth are you talking about? ""Anti-immigration rhetoric""? He said that this needs stricter border controls. Nowhere does he mention immigrants.If there are people with Ebola in other countries, why should we not have better screening at the border so as to ensure we do what we can to keep it out if at all possible? ""Regardless of any self interest""?? - Hey everyone there's a deadly disease making the rounds, lets be sure we don't do anything stupid or selfish like look out for ourselves. Top notch commentary - really.

Comment 3: In the spirit of the sentiments you propose... Scotland is a small remote country - if only we had independence we could control our borders and keep out English infected during their business trips and gap year visits to West Africa. Not sure I'm for that old chap.

Comment 4: Ever heard of an incubation period? ""Border control"" is a clearly a knee-jerk not based on an informed view of how to control a virus. Given the poster also says the UK's ONLY priority should be avoiding importation, it's pretty safe to say their agenda is more anti-foreigner than anti-virus (a) because control of the virus abroad is in our interests too and (b) because it's perfectly possible to focus on preventing spread to the UK and care about the impact elsewhere - they're not mutually exclusive.

Comment 5: <blockquote>  If there are people with Ebola in other countries, why should we not have better screening at the border so as to ensure we do what we can to keep it out if at all possible? </blockquote>  Because: 1. It's not worth the expense. 2. Ebola isn't very easy to catch. 3. Putting up ever more barriers to keep out those dirty foreigners is turning us into a nation of racists.

Comment 6: Not very easy to catch, eh? Here is <a href=""http://www.godlikeproductions.com/external?https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2eHr5sroQZ4"" rel=""nofollow"">a video </a>of the Spanish priest being removed from the plane in Spain. Why all the palava if it is not very easy to catch?

Comment 7: When AIDS was made a homophobic issue instead of a public health issue (as it should have been), it has continued to spread and millions have died. This is not a race issue, it is a public health issue.Lucky for other countries that people in these countries are having their temperature taken before boarding planes as they should, because in the countries effected it is what it is...a public health issue.

Comment 8: <blockquote>  Why all the palava if it is not very easy to catch? </blockquote>  Because then you'd be complaining not enough precautions were in place.

Comment 9: There are a lot of people who are quite scared now. You are obviously not one of them. There is a desperate shortage of aid workers now, why not volunteer to go and lend a hand?  I'm sure they will give you some rubber gloves and a paper mask which is, as I'm sure you will agree, plenty of protection against what is a fairly mild and difficult to catch virus. Then you can come home to the hero's reception that will be awaitng you!

Comment 10: <blockquote>  Why all the palava if it is not very easy to catch? </blockquote>  There were three incidences of a ""rollover"" by 737 Boeing jumbo jets caused by the design of a certain valve that operated the rudder. When it was freezing cold, and when burning hot oil flowed through it, there was a tiny tiny chance the valve could jam and put the rudder out. Three incidences, in 40 years of air travel by an aircraft design which has more flight hours than anything else. One of those aircraft takes off every minute. These weren't three incidences per aeroplane, these were three incidences ever, and the investigation went on for years because it was so hard to figure this out. Nothing had happened during testing, things had been tried and retried. And it was a mystery for the NTSB for a decade. When the cause of the three rollovers was found found what did they say? Did they say ""well this happens only 0.0000001% of the time the aeroplanes are in the air and will likely never happen again for another 10 years, so forget about it""? No, they had the FAA change the valve on every single aeroplane in service as a precautionary measure. When you are talking about a disease like Ebola, which is very very nasty if caught, precautionary measures will be taken above and beyond what would work, simply because it is better to be safe than sorry.

Comment 11: <blockquote>  What on earth are you talking about? ""Anti-immigration rhetoric""? He said that this needs stricter border controls. Nowhere does he mention immigrants. </blockquote>  Pope123 said:  <blockquote>  Once again the need to far stronger border controls is demonstrated. </blockquote>  The use of the phrase 'once again' would suggest that the accusation that Pope was spouting anti-immigration rhetoric is completely justified.  And re border controls, it's not a perfect situation by any means, but open borders are far more controlled than closed borders. Closed borders will mean that people will travel illegally, under the radar, and we'll have no way of knowing where or when the virus has been spread.

Comment 12: Explain the camps in Calais

Comment 13: <blockquote>  What on earth are you talking about? ""Anti-immigration rhetoric""? He said that this needs stricter border controls. Nowhere does he mention immigrants. </blockquote>  No he doesn't mention the word immigrants, but the word doesn't have to be used, ""strict border controls"" metonymically signifies, immigrants. Its quite possible he could have meant something else, but a quick perusal of previous posts suggests that it was an anit-immigration reference.  <blockquote>  ""Regardless of any self interest""?? - Hey everyone there's a deadly disease making the rounds, lets be sure we don't do anything stupid or selfish like look out for ourselves. </blockquote>  Looking out for ourselves is not inconsistent with looking out for others. The selfish part comes not from looking out for yourself but in saying screw the others,

Comment 14: What is sickening and selfish is people like Mohamed Tholley who i believe has not yet been found and could possible be infected putting many at risk.Do you believe china were concerned about immigration when they shut down an area that just recently had case of the plague?There are many people in these effected areas who want to leave and seek sanction in uk, honestly i don't blame them as it is a terrible situation to be in but then the task of screening everyone in reality is to much of a cost and it is indeed safer and cheeper to if not close entirely or put massive restrictions at boarder control and all linked flights in and out of know infected areas. You have to keep in mind volunteers are more reluctant to go and help making the issue even greater problem without sufficient care plus common sense will tell you that in such fast moving and heavily populated areas such as london the virus would spread like wild fire. It has nothing to do with anti-immigration or people being selfish in anyway to take steps in protecting our country the best way we can.

Comment 15: <blockquote>  What on earth are you talking about? </blockquote> What on Earth are you talking about more like?  It only takes a moment to check on someone's previous comments..  A typical UKIP politico supporter using this terrible disease to push their nasty agenda is despicable.. particularly as the health threat to UK and humanity is so severe.  It is yet another reason UKIP should be exposed as a far-right, cynical bank & corp sales psychopath lobby.. and kicked out of UK politics by everybody.

Comment 16: my goodness, aren't you a charming fellow. border controls are a waste of time and money, and only encourage kneejerk idiocy like your comment above. screening travelers for febrile illnesses is all that's needed. and it benefits everyone in the world to provide aid to the countries affected by the outbreak, precisely to moderate the outbreak and prevent further international transmission. immigration has nowt to do wi't. maybe you should go away and learn to think.

Comment 17: this virus doesn't spread like wildfire, not even in Liberia. it is not flu, and is far harder to catch than flu. don't touch dead people, or the bodily secretions of the sick ones, and you're all clear. I suspect the only reason the doctors are catching it has more to do with complete exhaustion suppressing their immune function, as doctors tend to work till they drop in such a situation. and border controls never work the way the idiots think they do.

Comment 18: Who says it's not easy to catch ? Read the hot zone, in it a CDC scientist say you could get ebola/marburg by just having 4 or 5 virus particles on your eye lid. Assuming that's correct and given how many medics have contracted it despite being covered head to toe I'd say it's quite easy to catch. For example, someone who has it touches something like a door handle, handrail, is a bit sweaty and then you touch the same surface and then you touch/rub your eye, bingo..

Comment 19: Border controls only help to pick up people who are symptomatic. It is possible to pass on the infection during the incubation stage. Therefore if an index patient travels to Paris and rides on a bus, before you know it you have infected weekend holiday makers returning home to the Common Travel Area. (CTA - I think I've just found a new name for the British Isles if Scotland gains independence - Ireland's already in the CTA). The best chance of fighting this is at source.

Comment 20: <blockquote>  Who says it's not easy to catch ? </blockquote>  <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/30/ebola-outbreak-uk-no-treatment-hard-to-catch"" rel=""nofollow"">This guy</a>.  <blockquote>  Read the hot zone, in it a CDC scientist say you could get ebola/marburg by just having 4 or 5 virus particles on your eye lid. </blockquote>  I have. It's about as ""non-fictional"" as the Amtyville horror. It's sensationalized crap intended to confound and bedazzle the gullible.

Comment 21: oh, FFS! The Hot Zone is a popular semifictional story, told to make money and entertain bored people for a while. it doesn't much resemble reality. the doctors who got infected probably ran themselves right into the ground working who knows how many hours a day and days in a row -- because that's what doctors *do* in these situations. the precautions are being taken just in case -- but if it was that damned easy to catch we'd be re-enacting ""The Stand"" already -- and we're not, we're not even close to that. calm the fuck down, man.

Comment 22: A person who travelled from Nigeria is being held in isolation in a hospital in Ontario, Canada, while they await test results. He's not being held due to racist attitudes. Your thinking shows the danger of political correctness.

Comment 23: It is not top-notch anything. The tone of the comment is clearly,  ""Sod them, just don't let it get into the UK!"" Which makes it rather unpleasant comment, frankly.

Comment 24: Talking about someone already being sick in an isolation ward is totally different than talking about denying people entry to the country based on their nationality. Your thinking shows the danger of cognitive dissonance to justify bigotry.

Comment 25: A woman has been quarantined in Cardiff amid fears she may have been exposed to the deadly Ebola virus.The potential victim, who has not been named, is being monitored by medics on a daily basis at home in Wales after visiting west Africa.I wonder if she went there to poke at peoples shit or fuck dead people!!!? Now with this and again the missing athlete do you honestly not think this is a huge threat to the british peoples health?Your ignorance is the type that will bite you an the arse and you would still point the finger elsewhere.If you honestly believe that a an open victim in london would not spread the virus faster that it has gone around already then there is no hope for you. The fact of the matter is we should be protecting this country by all costs and not be in the simplistic mind of it hasn't effected me yet so i'm ok which is one of the biggest reasons this country is already messed up. The biggest question to you i suppose is, would you travel to an infected area and if not why not?

Comment 26: Just to add Guinea have closed their boarders, would that be because they are anti-immigration nut jobs, playing it safe or in your words ""idiots""?

Comment 27: International help should include actions regarding border controls to try to keep this terrible disease from spreading any further. To be effective these should go a great deal further than simply trying to spot individuals at ports of entry who are demonstrating symptoms.

Comment 28: <blockquote>  To be effective these should go a great deal further than simply trying to spot individuals at ports of entry who are demonstrating symptoms. </blockquote>  We should start the construction of internment camps immediately, if not sooner.

You think they can just go and hang as long as it does not reach our shores? You'd prefer it if we just sit back and watch the entertainment? Judging by your comment history, you don't come across as very rational or pleasant.

Nowhere does he mention immigrants. </blockquote>  No he doesn't mention the word immigrants, but the word doesn't have to be used, ""strict border controls"" metonymically signifies, immigrants. Its quite possible he could have meant something else, but a quick perusal of previous posts suggests that it was an anit-immigration reference.  <blockquote>  ""Regardless of any self interest""?? - Hey everyone there's a deadly disease making the rounds, lets be sure we don't do anything stupid or selfish like look out for ourselves. </blockquote>  Looking out for ourselves is not inconsistent with looking out for others.

37,Ebola is likely to spread to the UK. ,"Main topic: Ebola is likely to spread to the UK. 

Comment 1: As Ebola has up to a three week gestation period and London is teeming with people from the West Africa coming and going on sweaty London tubes we have an ideal infection route via escalator handrails, train hand-holds, ticket machines etc etc etc. So there isn't a hope in hell of keeping it out of London if it really gets going in Nigeria for example.

Comment 2: You're probably already infected from merely reading this article. Head for the hills, now!!! It's your only chance. Save yourself.

Comment 3: People fit enough to travel aren't infectious.

Comment 4: obviously you are an expert in relation to the transmission of this infection.Your services are probably needed in the areas affected. I assume you are on your way.

Comment 5: 'People fit enough to travel aren't infectious.' You mean apart from that guy who flew by plane to Lagos with ebola? It seems so far that only the doctor and a nurse, who treated him, contracted the virus, but we can't be certain yet. The fact is that you can definitely travel while experiencing the initial symptoms.

Comment 6: Patrick Sawyer hopped on a plane knowing he was infected. A lady vomiting inside a cab started the Liberian outbreak.

Comment 7: Youre back to this? Well, obviously you're wrong because of what's happening in Lagos. Someone was (just) fit enough to travel, and they infected 9 people that we know of. Someone was fit enough to travel to Morocco and die there.Someone was fit enough to travel to Saudi Arabia and die there. Get the point? They've admitted that they have no idea how many people could be infected in Morocco, and they don't even seem to really care. How long is a flight from Morocco to London?

Comment 8: The suspected Moroccan case is reported to have been a heart attack victim, and there is still no confirmation of the suspected Saudi case. You can travel while infected, but not showing symptoms. What's so hard to understand about that?

Comment 9: The Liberian guy who died in Nigeria was showing symptoms while on the plane. He collapsed as he was getting off the plane. Now 9 people who had contact with him are infected. What's so hard to understand about that?

Comment 10: <blockquote>  Now 9 people who had contact with him are infected. </blockquote>  Nope, 6 of which are suspected, no confirmation of actual infection.

Comment 11: You neglected to say that all of those he infected were hospital workers attending to him. There is still no evidence of Ebola virus transmission by casual contact, such as sitting next to an infected person on a plane, but you seem quite desperate to convince us that this does happen, and that it poses the risk of a global pandemic.

Comment 12: wrong, at least one person was someone who helped him off the plane

Comment 13: Really? I think you just made that up.

Comment 14: To be fair he does have a point.

Comment 15: There has never been a case of Ebola in the Western hemisphere. So his point is moot.

Comment 16: I find people who sarcastically volunteer others for duty simply because they don't agree with them to be extremely tiresome. The original commentator has a point. London and even more so - Paris, have huge ties to Africa and are therefore quite exposed. An infected but non symptomatic patient could potentially spread the virus through shared items which are touched. This is how SARS was spread. Plastic lift buttons proved to be good reservoirs too.  For the above reason it is in the UK's interest to help stop the spread at source.

Comment 17: The doctors are treating people who have become seriously ill, and are infectious. What has that got to do with symptomless travellers?

40,The labour government spent too much money on the armed forces.,"Main topic: The labour government spent too much money on the armed forces.

Comment 1: yes because obviously labour will just spunk billions at the armed forces. maybe they could use the bankers bonus tax for the 28th time to buy 5 more american sized aircraft carriers.  or perhaps if labour had done the commissioning job more sensibly then the costs might be different or only one would have been built. but of course it is the fault of the evil tories.....

Comment 2: <blockquote>  ""... labour had done the commissioning job more sensibly ... "" </blockquote>  Given what has happened since 2010 with regard to the aircraft carriers, their aircraft and defence procurement in general, I have come to the conclusion that commissioning 'more sensibly' actually means awarding contracts to mates and business partners rather than competitive tendering. Would I be right?

Comment 3: What a refined answer. It's not Labour butchering the armed forces it's the tories. If Labour had set in train the present cuts the right wing papers would have been bellowing non-stop. I never trust tories on defence and security - they are penny pinchers. Their attempts to cut costs by making the best trained army in the world little more than a border defence force, and filling it out with reservists is, as predicted, a complete farce.

Comment 4: Bit harsh to blame the Tories for these aircraft carriers being inadequate. Labour ordered 2 carriers but didn't plan for the associated support craft(frigates destroyers etc), hence why one will be mothballed. They also ordered the wrong planes.

Comment 5: I'm not blaming them for the carriers, I'm just saying their defence cuts are a disgrace. It's not lack of support ships that is likely to cause mothballing - it's tory defence cuts. Wasn't it them who cut the number of T45 destroyers, designed to escort the carriers, from 8 to 6 ?

Comment 6: i am angry about cuts to the armed forces - very angry - but to be honest where is the money to avoid cuts. can you imagine the outcry if defence spending was ring-fenced or increased when there are cuts everywhere else. as usual the bean-counters in whitehall and government are ""fighting the last war"" and we see countlessly that we are unprepared when something happens and have to play catch-up however i just dont see where the money is for more ships (something i believe passionately in), soldiers and planes. it is frankly a no-win situation for any government at the moment.

Comment 7: <blockquote>  Wasn't it them who cut the number of T45 destroyers, designed to escort the carriers, from 8 to 6 ? </blockquote>  It was Bob Ainsworth.

Would I be right?  </blockquote>  These two carriers (when one would have been enough) were commissioned and built in Scotland purely to garner votes for Brown and Labour. They even made the wrong decisions on aircraft leaving an unholy, expensive mess for the Coalition to clean up. Any contracts for mates would have been the responsibility of Labour so I don't see why you are attempting to smear the Tories when the party of lies and corruption were voted out in 2010. Remember Ecclestone, Hinduja, Mandelson and all the Labour MPs sent to gaol before smearing a party that has restored the economy and faith in public services.

Comment 9: No it was in 2008 that the number of type 45's was cut to 6.I don't agree with the defence cuts either, I'd much prefer the overseas aid budget cut but the Labour regime deserves to take the blame far more than the Tories.

Comment 10: <blockquote>  but of course it is the fault of the evil tories..... </blockquote>  Well, they are pretty shit.

Comment 11: Ah, well you seem to know a lot about it. Would you please explain exactly what happened in 2010? How exactly did the Coalition effect the contracts, the cost and the over-all project with their flip-flopping on the ships and the planes? On a more general note, how was it okay for the Coalition to renege on UK Government contracts signed and sealed. Reneging on contracts is poor business practise (because it is so expensive to alter contracts and because no-one willingly enters into a transaction if they can't be sure the deal will be honoured.) The Coalition's Party driven petulance since 2010 over existing government commitments has under-mined the UK government's reputation as a business partner. Well?

Comment 12: <blockquote>  i am angry about cuts to the armed forces - very angry </blockquote>  As long as Britain doesn't get involved in the kind of foreign 'adventures' that Blair loved so much, the armed forces are actually too large. Britain has the fourth largest military budget in the world, but doesn't face any substantial military threats not of its own making. Your anger is your own issue.

Comment 13: Labour ordered these white elephants (see details on Chinese anti-carrier ballistic missiles) as part of a job-creating vote catching project. It would have been cheaper to have given the builders a few 100K£ each -- though the electoral bribe would have been a little too transparent.

Comment 14: <blockquote>  These two carriers were commissioned and built in Scotland purely to garner votes for Brown and Labour. </blockquote>  They were assembled in Scotland and built on four different British yards. The reason they were assembled on the Clyde is obvious. Firstly, Goven and Rosythe have specialised naval yards placingthem at an advantage for this role. Secondly, I can't think of any other UK shipyards - let alone naval yards - that remain with dry-dock facilities large enough to accomodate a fully completed hull of this size anywhere in the UK - can you?  Where do you think it should be assembled? The Tyne, The Mersey or perhaps The Wear? Well these are non-starter's due to the closure of all their dry-docks over 1980-85 and the failure to dredge riverside walves and river-beds. The two largest dry-dock's on the Tyne, would be a possibility but they are now 'water-features' that are part of riverside housing complexes. Maybe this physical and logistical impossibility is purely down to 'Brown garnering votes'? The nearest dry-dock of that size outside Glasgow is probably Zee-Land, or St Nazaire where the similar sized Charles de Gaulle was assembled.

Comment 15: as part of a job-creating vote catching project. Well, it's a change from saying Gordon Brown had them ordered as they would be built in his constituency - shown as a lie by the simple fact that they have been constructed around the UK in sections. Still wrong though - western navies are ordering carriers (smaller) and landing ships to deal with the 'asymmetrical' threats posed by terrorist groups and have been doing so for years.

Comment 16: before smearing a party that has restored the economy and faith in public services. laughable - they plunged the economy into extended contraction and far from restoring faith in public services have cut them drastically for ideological reasons. No doubt you blame the world financial crash on 'socialist overspending' as well. Cameron and the tories still thought they were too regulated - imagine how bad it would have been if they'd got their way.

Comment 17: These two carriers were commissioned and built in Scotland purely to garner votes for Brown and Labour. This is, as the tories know, an out and out lie. Reminds me of the charge that Labour are the party of the 'layabouts', yet when the incompetency of ATOS is raised they shout 'Labour introduced them'. Can't be the party of the lazy and bring in ATOS, after all.

Comment 18: <blockquote>  They even made the wrong decisions on aircraft leaving an unholy, expensive mess for the Coalition to clean up. Any contracts for mates would have been the responsibility of Labour so I don't see why you are attempting to smear the Tories when the party of lies and corruption were voted out in 2010. </blockquote>  Not entirely true. There was the opportunity to install catapults and traps, making the carriers compatible with French and US naval aircraft and giving the option of buying the cheap, effective and in-service F/A18 Super Hornet (from Boeing). The US Navy even offered to help. Instead, BaE insisted that it couldn't be done without spending billions and so now these carriers will only be able to fly the absolute clusterfuck that is the F-35B - if they ever get it to work - and which, co-incidentally, is part manufactured by... BaE. It's an absolute disgrace and it happened on Cameron's watch after BaE effectively blackmailed the government.

Comment 19: [ref to tories] 'a party that has restored the economy and faith in public services' as an undoubted attempt at humour, i find this utterly tasteless.

It accounts for 3.4% of the global economy and 3.3% of global military spending.

Comment 22: Not really. Unlike previous carriers (or the US and French nuclear carriers/carrier) the Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales are powered by gas turbine/electric drives and hence lack the serious steam generation capacity which is needed for conventional aircraft catapults. The opportunity may arise in future to convert them to use electromagnetic catapults (planned for the next generation of US carriers) but that is an as yet unproven technology. The carriers should have been nuclear powered with steam catapults but that was ruled out at the start (I agree about the F-35B).

Comment 23: Wonderful Nu Labour cut the forces more than the ConDems have done (e.g. Navy cut by 35%) and committed them to two prolonged conflicts which they were not equipped or resourced to fight. Everything they did in defence, including the carrier project, was a complete shambles and none of their clueless lightweight defence secretaries could manage to stay in the job for more than 6 months. What a bunch of clowns.

Comment 24: Nu Labour defence cuts were a bigger disgrace: 1 aircraft carrier cut (Invincible decommissioned 8 years early).6 destroyers cut (T45 order reduced from 12 to 6).6 frigates cut (including 3 almost new T23 frigates).SSN force reduced from 12 to 7.Sea Harriers axed 10 years early, some of them only 9 years old.Helicopter numbers cut.Deep cuts to minor war vessels and support ships, operating budget and training also cut. They axed 35% of the Navy between 1997 and 2013 but were the experts at covering up their destructive handywork with gloss and spin.

Comment 25: Saudi Arabia's big spending in the last two years is a short-term spike - they've just completed huge deals for new American fighter-bombers, German tanks and other armoured vehicles, and will start taking delivery next year of new warships ordered in a £10-bn naval expansion programme in 2011.In another year or two, the UK will most likely be back in the top 5.

Comment 26: It's the EMALS system I was talking about. It's about to undergo sea trials in the new USS Gerald Ford carriers and will be in full service in two years, so a it's bit further along than 'unproven'. <a href=""http://www.engineering.com/DesignerEdge/DesignerEdgeArticles/ArticleID/7609/Navy-Readies-Electromagnetic-Carrier-Base-Catapult.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineering.com/DesignerEdge/DesignerEdgeArticles/ArticleID/7609/Navy-Readies-Electromagnetic-Carrier-Base-Catapult.aspx</a> The US Navy offered full support for their installation in the QE.

Comment 27: Quite possibly. Exchange rate changes might also put it ahead of France again by next year. But with China and Russia increasing military spending at double digit rates annually, Japan implementing its own increases in response to China's (and amending its constitution), and India set to become a huge spender itself, the UK looks set to fall behind the big spenders.

Comment 28: Well I don't know. Do you have any hard evidence?

Comment 29: Labour ordered the same planes the Tories went back to after they announced they were the wrong planes and wasted millions trying to retrofit steam catapults to a finalised design... this delayed the date the aircraft carrier (one) actually had aircraft even further........... still Labours fault?

Comment 30: Labour ordered the planes and the carriers. The Tories realised that the worst planes had been ordered and tried to change the order, they then found out the aircraft carrier that Labour had ordered was also inadequate and therefore had no choice but to accept the crap planes. So yes it is ANOTHER Labour cock up.

41,Britain should spend more money on its armed forces.,"Main topic: Britain should spend more money on its armed forces.

Comment 1: i am angry about cuts to the armed forces - very angry - but to be honest where is the money to avoid cuts. can you imagine the outcry if defence spending was ring-fenced or increased when there are cuts everywhere else. as usual the bean-counters in whitehall and government are ""fighting the last war"" and we see countlessly that we are unprepared when something happens and have to play catch-up however i just dont see where the money is for more ships (something i believe passionately in), soldiers and planes. it is frankly a no-win situation for any government at the moment.

Comment 2: <blockquote>  i am angry about cuts to the armed forces - very angry </blockquote>  As long as Britain doesn't get involved in the kind of foreign 'adventures' that Blair loved so much, the armed forces are actually too large. Britain has the fourth largest military budget in the world, but doesn't face any substantial military threats not of its own making. Your anger is your own issue.

Comment 3: Britain has the sixth largest military expenditure (figures US$ billion, 2013): 1 United States 640.0 2 China 188.0 3 Russia 87.8 4 Saudi Arabia 67.0 5 France 61.2 6 United Kingdom 57.9 It's also the sixth largest economy, so its military spending corresponds. It accounts for 3.4% of the global economy and 3.3% of global military spending.

Comment 4: Saudi Arabia's big spending in the last two years is a short-term spike - they've just completed huge deals for new American fighter-bombers, German tanks and other armoured vehicles, and will start taking delivery next year of new warships ordered in a £10-bn naval expansion programme in 2011.In another year or two, the UK will most likely be back in the top 5.

Comment 5: Quite possibly. Exchange rate changes might also put it ahead of France again by next year. But with China and Russia increasing military spending at double digit rates annually, Japan implementing its own increases in response to China's (and amending its constitution), and India set to become a huge spender itself, the UK looks set to fall behind the big spenders.

Keeping them for another 10 years was not a viable option and comes back to the mistakes made by Labour when commissioning these 2 carries when only one was required.

Comment 2: Fair point - I stand corrected. Though two were commissioned so there would always be one available. The French navy has only 1 carrier and were having huge problems with that.

Comment 4: Since when is only one required?? what rubbish is that, so if something goes wrong wrong , all our capability lost. two minimum.

Comment 5: The Harrier is a lovely aircraft but very complex and enormously expensive to run, and around 50 years old (at least from prototype). That said, the running costs probably pale into nothing compared to the vast expenditure in R&D on dubious replacements that may not be much better.

I bet the Americans couldn't believe their fucking luck.

Comment 9: Plenty of crashes but not that many deaths considering it is a single engine aircraft designed to operate at the very edge of its capabilities. The F35 will be no more reliable or survivable, if it ever gets off the drawing board, for at least 10 times the money.

Comment 13: Actually, it's around £3.2 billion per ship or the equivalent to six months of the UK aid budget.

Comment 14: 1) Nu Labour killed British fixed-wing naval aviation when they scrapped the far more useful Sea Harriers in 2004-6. The GR9s we were left with were useless to the Navy as they could not provide fleet air defence - the main reason for having them in the first place. A GR9 carrier air wing would be a waste of time - all it would be able to do is provide close air support in a low-threat environment. It would be comprehensively slaughtered by even moderately capable opposition. 2) By 2007/8 we had no fixed-wing carrier capability to speak of anyway as the 10 GR9s maintained at readiness were deployed in Afghanistan, as were the Sea King AEW helicopters, and carrier training and deployment had more or less been abandoned. The rest of the GR9s were mothballed or being raided for spares to keep the aircraft in Afghanistan going. We could not have put together a viable carrier air wing even if we had wanted to. 3) The only reason the USMC bought the UK Harriers is to cannibalise them for spares to keep their more capable AV-8B Harrier 2s flying until the F35B arrives. They have no option as parts for such an old aircraft are now in short supply and there is no other jet that can fly from their assault ships.

Comment 15: <blockquote>  Could have used Harriers - except the tories sold them at a knock down price to the US Marine Corps. </blockquote>  Except they're not really a viable option for the vital Air Defence/Strike roles are they?They are not operated from Aircraft Carriers by the US Marines and aren't tasked with an air defence role.They are deployed from Helicopter Carriers (and operate from on-shore Forward Operating Bases at the earliest possible opportunity) as Close Support Aircraft in area's were they won't encounter enemy aircraft or supported by other Fighters.

Comment 16: I'm not saying it was obsolete but it is notoriously complex and fuel hungry especially in vertical VTOL mode. Although it only has one pilot it costs twice as much to train him compared to a Tornado pilot and flying costs are greater to the tune of approx £2000 per flying hour. Of course, there are two personnel in a Tornado so that helps to balance costs in that respect. I'm not making a judgement here. These are just some of the facts. Both aircraft have their strengths and weaknesses. However, it seems like both are better, and certainly more proven, than the F-35 in its current slightly shaky form. I don't work for BAE. Do you work for the Navy?

Comment 17: Correct, but most people do not realise this. They confuse the GR9 with the Sea Harrier, for the Navy the only worthwhile variant as they could provide fleet air defence. Nu Labour did the real damage when they prematurely scrapped the Sea Harriers. However, it was done with such sleight of hand that unless you take an interest in the military you probably would not know anything about it.

It is the water tower he opposes.

Comment 6: You know, this is an excellent example of how to misrepresent the truth. The guy is suing to stop construction of a water tower intended to supply trucks used to bring water to well sites. In other words, it has nothing to do with fracking. It has to do with truck traffic and the consequences. And in this case the truck traffic is associated with clean water transport.  I've written over 20 posts here at the Guardian pointing out the ""editorial line"" used to attack fracking is ludicrous. Those of us who have to deal with this problem can point out the problem is caused by issues you never discuss. It's things such as the truck traffic, the busted roads, and the noise which lead to conflict. Where I own my Texas property we chose to impose local regulations on the oil and gas companies, to make them bypass the urban areas with their trucks, pay to fix the roads, and to put landscaping and noise abatement around their well sites. But we aren't super rich like the ExxonMobil guy. We wanted the royalty money and the cash.

Comment 7: <blockquote>  The guy is suing to stop construction of a water tower intended to supply trucks used to bring water to well sites. In other words, it has nothing to do with fracking. </blockquote>  Of course it has. He wouldn't be suing anyone if it wasn't for fracking's need for water. Get a grip. It's okay for Rex to profit from fracking so long as the consequences aren't in his backyard.

Comment 8: Huh...there's no need to have a water tower built and water supply trucks in urban areas with expensive housing. You know, this is just common sense. Those landowners pay taxes according to the property appraisal, therefore the local tax district (whatever it is) should consider participating as amicus curiae in this particular litigation.  What we did where I lived and now rent is not too far from this guy's house (but I own a much cheaper property).  The approach taken was to regulate them and make them shift their practices to suit our aims, which were to make them pay taxes through their noses while at the same time driving our property prices up. This was achieved, and I believe it only took a couple of lawsuits to make them learn their lesson. And even though my particular property IS indeed gaining value, I'm still concerned over the landscaping they use to cover the walls we made them put around their well sites. They tend to be cheap and their flower bushes aren't well kept.

Comment 9: <blockquote>  Huh...there's no need to have a water tower built and water supply trucks in urban areas with expensive housing. </blockquote>  The fracking company thinks differently.  <blockquote>  You know, this is just common sense. </blockquote>  <a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Common_sense"" rel=""nofollow"">RationalWiki - Common sense</a> ""The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counter-intuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true."" -Carl Sagan

Comment 10: It's not a ""fracking company"". Such businesses supply water. I guess it's a bit too complex for some people to understand the legal and commercial structures. In general many enviromentalists aren't well acquainted with these topics, this is why they tend to be ineffective. It's what I call the ready fire aim syndrome.

Comment 11: Is the water for fracking? Yes. Have a nice day defending your salary.

Comment 12: <blockquote>  The 'antis' lost a lot of credibility with me today when one, one Radio 4, spoke of 'poisoning' the water supply. </blockquote>  Indeed..I heard that too. Methane is not only non toxic, it is also insoluble in water.  Nevertheless that same spokesman blethered on about poison and was also trying to tell us that we would all be blown up in our beds. Not a hint of scepticism of such an unlikely event by the BBC interviewer, either. There may be many reasons why fracking in GB may turn out not to be a good idea...but the sheer scale of breathtaking alarmism and well...just plain lying...by the anti-frack brigade is remarkable.  Still...they would appear to be winning. Just as well the shale gas will still be there when we frack it eventually. They cannot make it disapppear, much as they would like to.

Comment 13: By far, the biggest threat to your water well is pollution from the surface or near surface activities. Where does your waste water go, or that of your neighbours? If it goes to a septic tank with overflow (which is very common in rural areas), this represents a much much larger risk than deep shale fracking.  Also, how is your well protected? Is it protected from the risk of the pooh from rats, mice, livestock, birds, being washed into it by heavy rains? Does it have a filter to protect it from airborne microbes (which any good drinking wate well should have)? Is your water filtered and disinfected? Do you store it in tanks before drinking? These are all much greater risks.

Comment 14: Assertion without evidence. The Royal Society (who one assumes knows what it's talking about) says differently. Perhaps we need a test site to demonstrate the process?  Or are the anti-technology trustifarians scared they might be proven wrong?

Comment 15: Think you are just making stuff up. How do the "" frack fluids"", most of which would have been removed, fight gravity and make it's way up to the water table.

Comment 16: Less than 40% of the deadly chemically contaminated water is retrieved from each well, according to the industry. Please see this film which supports my point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdhq6JU5kNw

Comment 17: <blockquote>  How do the "" frack fluids"", most of which would have been removed, fight gravity and make it's way up to the water table. </blockquote>  <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.00933.x/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">Potential Contaminant Pathways from Hydraulically Fractured Shale to Aquifers</a>. Myers (2012) Plus, they don't have to migrate upwards if the well casing's bollocksed.

Comment 18: Ever heard of pressure?

Comment 19: Myers (2012) is not so much discredited, as never having been credited, like his acolyte Prof van Tonder.

Comment 20: The government and its Environment Agency cannot legislate, demonstrate nor prevent leaking of fracking fluid out of the target formation, in breach with EU law that the earth ought not to be used as a waste facility for fracking fluid. Estimates of betweem 25-75% of injected frack fluid NEVER returns to the surface- making thewhole countryside around a well pad contaminated if the process goes according to plan...as fractures can and do extend hundreds of metres away from the target formation, creating pathways for fluid migration. There is no testing or proof that contamination and this inevitable migration has not occurred at these depths.It is utter lies that this industry is being or can be regulated and done safely. You simply cannot tell shattered rock and frack fluid where not to go. This myth is what the whole joke is clinging onto It is worth studying the truth of this process its regulation and actual lack of, and writing to the EA in technical detail as I have should you wish to verify my points.

Comment 21: In Queensland's Great Artesian Basin water in the sandstone aquifers at depth makes its way up the bore to the surface in many places without pumping by windmills due to hydraulic pressure; which in simplistic terms is simply water finding its own level with the assistance of gravity: the intake area for the basin being at a higher elevation in the eastern highlands than the land surface up to a thousand kilometres to the west.

Comment 22: As already stated, fracking fluid is only partly removed from wells.Question is, how is that fluid disposed of ? In the states they have tried evaporation ponds, which quickly killed birds who mistook it for water. When dried up the remaining chemicals were spread about by wind in dust storms contaminating everything it came into contact with, making sick and even killing livestock, sterilizing agricultural land, AND contamination fresh surface water when the contaminated dust settled in same.They then tried injecting this fluid into underground cavities of various natures, and all of a sudden we saw earthquakes occurring in states that have never had an earth quake.C'mon people, do your own homework, there's plenty of evidence readily available to prove to anyone, (who is not a share holder in a fracking company, this procedure is very dangerous for our environment indeed.) this fracking business is a dire threat to us all.Oh, by the way, check also how many wells fracked in the U.S. failed inspections by their own E.P.A. and leaked contaminants into the ground via CRACKS in the concrete bore sides.

Comment 23: After holes in the horizontal pipe are formed by a ""necklace"" of shaped charges, fracking fluids are injected using a chain of high pressure pumps at 100 MPa (15,000 psi in obsolete units) to open fissures in the shale. The fluid contains chemicals including HCl which forms soluble salts with toxic metals (including radium and uranium) while the fissures are kept open to release the gas with sand or resins(Proppants) At these high pressures toxins can readily rise up enlongated fissures to contaminate aquifers.

Comment 24: Doubt it. The water all gets treated before we drink it. The methane would be removed during the treatment process along with all the other stuff.

Comment 25: The British Geological Society wouldn't agree!https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152939500757004

Comment 26: <blockquote>  Doubt it. </blockquote>  How reassuring.  <blockquote>  The water all gets treated before we drink it. </blockquote>  Would you have your kids drink a couple of glasses? If not, why not?

Comment 27: Do you know anything about the UK's drinking water treatment processes? They absolutely WOULD NOT remove the types of pollution that would arise from a failed shale gas well.

Comment 28: You cannot remove ethylene glycol form contaminated water. You do not even knwo the full list of disclosed frack chemicals as they are commercially sensitive and are hiding form public scrutiny. You also cannot verify- as I have endeavoured to find the location of the NORM disposal faacilities (radioactive waste waste and drill cuttings) from the Environment Agency Do you know where the radioactive and waste dumps are I wonder? Where will the frack fluid go? I imagine when it is within 10 km of your house you will do your homework to remove your doubt.

Comment 29: <blockquote>  You do not even knwo the full list of disclosed frack chemicals as they are commercially sensitive and are hiding form public scrutiny. </blockquote>  Another one just making things up. All chemicals must be declared to and then licensed by the environmental agency.

Comment 30: Yes, we know they list the chemicals, but what they don't do is list the quantities. Why do you think paracetomol has the quantity on the box, or do you take a whole box's worth when you get a headache? Oh that's right, you don't, because you'd possibly be dead and wouldn't be here pushing the fracking industry line.

Comment 31: <blockquote>  You cannot remove ethylene glycol form contaminated water. </blockquote>  amazing, then that glycol dessicant systems work as a closed loop...and that the chemical is such a threat that we use it routinely in volume in things like automotive anti-freeze. As to the NORM, would this be a reference to the tritium contaminated water at Barton? It's simple to dispose of - dilution. It's worth looking at what evidence there is of harm (or the lack of it) from tritium

Comment 32: President Obama says "". ""Sometimes there are disputes about natural gas,"" he said at his climate change speech last week at Georgetown, ""but let me say this: We should strengthen our position as the top natural gas producer because, in the medium term at least, it not only can provide safe, cheap power, but it can also help reduce our carbon emissions.""Sometimes you greenies cannot see the wood for the trees.

46,Fracking can be safely regulated,"Main topic: Fracking can be safely regulated

Comment 1: Any industrial process can be done badly and have very bad consequences. The answer is not to shut down industry or prevent the exploitation of new resources, but to ensure that proper regulation applies and that the job is done right. All and any oil or gas production COULD be done in a way that could create environmental havoc, The answer is to ensure that it is done right. Nearly all shale gas resources are extremely deep under ground, way below any ground water and as the article explains, mostly almost a kilometer below that level.There is no chance at all that cracks caused by fracking would go anywhere near. The danger zone is the well leading down to those deep levels. These vertical tubes need to be correctly lined with steel and concrete to prevent leakage as gas and oil gets near the surface. There is not a single oil or gas well in the world where this isn't an issue whether fracking is used or not, so the idea that we have a particular issue in fracking is balderdash and nonsense. The same risks apply to any hyrocarbon production and we have a long history of that in the UK and a good record.

Comment 2: It does depend on if the process is done properly. Some of those aquifers are 600m away from the shale..which should be fine. The 'antis' lost a lot of credibility with me today when one, one Radio 4, spoke of 'poisoning' the water supply. Methane isn't toxic. We need facts, not emotion.

Comment 3: <blockquote>  The 'antis' lost a lot of credibility with me today </blockquote>The pro's lost credibility with me today when one of them pretended they used to believe the antis were credible until they listened to a random person on the radio.

Comment 4: <blockquote>  The 'antis' lost a lot of credibility with me today when one, one Radio 4, spoke of 'poisoning' the water supply. </blockquote>  Indeed..I heard that too. Methane is not only non toxic, it is also insoluble in water.  Nevertheless that same spokesman blethered on about poison and was also trying to tell us that we would all be blown up in our beds. Not a hint of scepticism of such an unlikely event by the BBC interviewer, either. There may be many reasons why fracking in GB may turn out not to be a good idea...but the sheer scale of breathtaking alarmism and well...just plain lying...by the anti-frack brigade is remarkable.  Still...they would appear to be winning. Just as well the shale gas will still be there when we frack it eventually. They cannot make it disapppear, much as they would like to.

Comment 7: Methane isn't toxic. Some of the chemicals used in the process are.

Comment 8: <blockquote>  Methane isn't toxic. </blockquote>  In high enough quantity it's a pollutant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere that raises temperature over a short period, and then converts into CO2 to raise temperatures over much longer periods.

Comment 9: <blockquote>  In high enough quantity it's a pollutant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere that raises temperature over a short period, and then converts into CO2 to raise temperatures over much longer periods. </blockquote>  But it's not toxic.....

Comment 14: Almost all industrial activities present a risk to groundwater if not properly regulated and managed. Regarding underground activities, that includes tunnelling (road, rail), oil wells, conventional gas wells, sewage networks, building foundations and basements, underground car parks, petrol station storage tanks, etc, etc. If we can manage these, why assume we can't manage fracking wells? Is it you are just gullible?

Comment 15: You seem to think contrarian is a constant position. Being a scientist, I believe in anthropogenic climate change, but think it's possible to frack safely.

Comment 16: Did I suggest anything like that? I was suggesting that ""CO2 is plant food so it cannot possibly cause problems"" is a nice slogan but it is so plainly specious that whoever says it is either a fool or a knave. Things are a bit more complicated than that. Plants need CO2, water (not too much, not too little), light, warmth (not too much, not too little), nutrients (not too much, not too little) and a miriad of other things. You say you are a scientist so you do not need to be told that an excess CO2 in the atmosphere causes a lot of trouble. I understood you said that ""CO2 is plant food so it cannot possibly cause problems"" is the best argument contrarians have. In that case, contrarians have no argument whatsoever. The atmosphere on Venus is almost completely composed of CO2. Plants don't love it. As to fracking, I don't agree with it. Granted, it's probably better than coal but that's not saying much: being hit by a car is better than being hit by a truck. More importantly, it just propagates the fossil-fuel model, the growth paradigm, the cake now and fuck later ideology. It's a road ending in tears.

Comment 17: We shouldn't concentrate so much on depth of shale but worry more about well integrity. If they overlap, the gas has to be brought through that aquifer safely and if something goes wrong with the well casing then.... bye bye aquifer.

Comment 18: Doubt it. The water all gets treated before we drink it. The methane would be removed during the treatment process along with all the other stuff.

Comment 20: <blockquote>  Doubt it. </blockquote>  How reassuring.  <blockquote>  The water all gets treated before we drink it. </blockquote>  Would you have your kids drink a couple of glasses? If not, why not?

Comment 21: By the time the gas is level with aquifers, it is travelling through the centre of at least 5 concentric alternating layers of steel and cement. Its very unlikely that all 5 (or more) seperately installed and cemented layers would simultaneously fail if things are done properly.  With the extra BGS info, it means higher risk areas can be identified and avoided or the risks mitigated by extra technical or legal requirements. Unlike the USA, the British Geological Survey have run and are continuing to run a survey of methane naturally present in our groundwater, so there will be far greater transparency to the process here with a reference baseline.  In the US, the US Geological Survey has conducted a survey in New York state which has maintained a moratorium on fracking. It found a lot of natural methane in the rivers and wells of New York state including many water wells which needed action or monitoring to prevent explosion. Maybe the residents of the adjoining state of Pennsylvania could have done with some baseline monitoring before their state was drilled.<a href=""http://www.waterworld.com/articles/wwi/print/volume-27/issue-5/editorial-focus/groundwater-development-flow-modelling/new-york-new-yorks-dissolved-methane-concerns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Waterworld article reporting USGS reporton natural methane levels in NY</a>

Comment 2: We have a borehole on our farm on the South Downs and it is only 84m deep. We get a lot of pure water from that.. Any risk at all, when the risk assessment modelling has been so poor, it totally unacceptable. There are other ways to source our energy.

Comment 3: It does depend on if the process is done properly. Some of those aquifers are 600m away from the shale..which should be fine. The 'antis' lost a lot of credibility with me today when one, one Radio 4, spoke of 'poisoning' the water supply. Methane isn't toxic. We need facts, not emotion.

Comment 4: <blockquote>  The 'antis' lost a lot of credibility with me today </blockquote>The pro's lost credibility with me today when one of them pretended they used to believe the antis were credible until they listened to a random person on the radio.

Comment 5: <blockquote>  The 'antis' lost a lot of credibility with me today when one, one Radio 4, spoke of 'poisoning' the water supply. </blockquote>  Indeed..I heard that too. Methane is not only non toxic, it is also insoluble in water.  Nevertheless that same spokesman blethered on about poison and was also trying to tell us that we would all be blown up in our beds. Not a hint of scepticism of such an unlikely event by the BBC interviewer, either. There may be many reasons why fracking in GB may turn out not to be a good idea...but the sheer scale of breathtaking alarmism and well...just plain lying...by the anti-frack brigade is remarkable.  Still...they would appear to be winning. Just as well the shale gas will still be there when we frack it eventually. They cannot make it disapppear, much as they would like to.

Comment 6: The government and its Environment Agency cannot legislate, demonstrate nor prevent leaking of fracking fluid out of the target formation, in breach with EU law that the earth ought not to be used as a waste facility for fracking fluid. Estimates of betweem 25-75% of injected frack fluid NEVER returns to the surface- making thewhole countryside around a well pad contaminated if the process goes according to plan...as fractures can and do extend hundreds of metres away from the target formation, creating pathways for fluid migration. There is no testing or proof that contamination and this inevitable migration has not occurred at these depths.It is utter lies that this industry is being or can be regulated and done safely. You simply cannot tell shattered rock and frack fluid where not to go. This myth is what the whole joke is clinging onto.

Comment 7: By far, the biggest threat to your water well is pollution from the surface or near surface activities. Where does your waste water go, or that of your neighbours? If it goes to a septic tank with overflow (which is very common in rural areas), this represents a much much larger risk than deep shale fracking.  Also, how is your well protected? Is it protected from the risk of the pooh from rats, mice, livestock, birds, being washed into it by heavy rains? Does it have a filter to protect it from airborne microbes (which any good drinking wate well should have)? Is your water filtered and disinfected? Do you store it in tanks before drinking? These are all much greater risks.

Comment 8: Assertion without evidence. The Royal Society (who one assumes knows what it's talking about) says differently. Perhaps we need a test site to demonstrate the process?  Or are the anti-technology trustifarians scared they might be proven wrong?

Comment 9: Methane isn't toxic. Some of the chemicals used in the process are.

Comment 10: <blockquote>  Methane isn't toxic. </blockquote>  In high enough quantity it's a pollutant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere that raises temperature over a short period, and then converts into CO2 to raise temperatures over much longer periods.

Comment 11: <blockquote>  In high enough quantity it's a pollutant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere that raises temperature over a short period, and then converts into CO2 to raise temperatures over much longer periods. </blockquote>  But it's not toxic..... Hence use of the word 'poison' is emotive and unscientific and is sued to mislead the public.

Comment 12: <blockquote>  But it's not toxic..... </blockquote>  So you agree that it's a pollutant? Progress at last.

Comment 13: I never said it wasn't. But drinking methane-laced water won't, so far as I'm aware, harm you.

Comment 14: It's so NOT the methane: <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/caudrilla-withdraws-applications-to-frack-in-lancashire-after-encountering-problems-with-radioactive-waste-disposal-9088986.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/caudrilla-withdraws-applications-to-frack-in-lancashire-after-encountering-problems-with-radioactive-waste-disposal-9088986.html</a>

Ponzi scheme. Subprime energy.

Comment 24: Don't invest if you don't like it.  You know, some of the comments we get about natural gas are incredibly funny. But the ones about natural gas not making money are just the result of a deep misunderstanding about how a commodity market works. In general this isn't a business for people with weak knees or shallow pockets. And this is why ex oilmen go to Houston Texas to sell belt buckles.

Comment 1: We do not need new sources of CO2, in fact in the strongest possible terms we should be moving away.  Shale gas is a false solution peddled by climate change deniers and those who would gladly see his soar past 4C in increased global temperatures to sate their greed.

Comment 2: <blockquote>  We do not need new sources of CO2 </blockquote>  Yeah, what did CO2 ever do for us? We can live quite well without it!

Comment 3: The thinking of a denier. ""Food is necessary for life, therefore there is no such thing as too much food."" There is no arguing with such wilful ignorance.

Comment 4: That's the best argument against, rather than the hysterics I here elsewhere.

Comment 5: If ""CO2 is plant food"" is the best arguments the contrarian crowd has, then the case is well and truly closed. Water is also necessary to life. I wonder what drowning people complain of?

Comment 6: You seem to think contrarian is a constant position. Being a scientist, I believe in anthropogenic climate change, but think it's possible to frack safely.

Comment 7: Did I suggest anything like that? I was suggesting that ""CO2 is plant food so it cannot possibly cause problems"" is a nice slogan but it is so plainly specious that whoever says it is either a fool or a knave. Things are a bit more complicated than that. Plants need CO2, water (not too much, not too little), light, warmth (not too much, not too little), nutrients (not too much, not too little) and a miriad of other things. You say you are a scientist so you do not need to be told that an excess CO2 in the atmosphere causes a lot of trouble. I understood you said that ""CO2 is plant food so it cannot possibly cause problems"" is the best argument contrarians have. In that case, contrarians have no argument whatsoever. The atmosphere on Venus is almost completely composed of CO2. Plants don't love it. As to fracking, I don't agree with it. Granted, it's probably better than coal but that's not saying much: being hit by a car is better than being hit by a truck. More importantly, it just propagates the fossil-fuel model, the growth paradigm, the cake now and fuck later ideology. It's a road ending in tears.

Comment 8: Fool! Liar!! Move to what? I drove nine hundred miles up and down from Northumberland to Cornwall last week, passing by hundreds of giant stationary wind mills on the way. As for your balderdash about a 4C rise in temperature..... The mean global temperature rose zero point eight of one degree C between 1850 and 1999. Since 1999 it has declined slightly and has never since got near the 1999 0.8 of one degree peak. You are either a liar or a fool.

Comment 9: <blockquote>  Since 1999 it has declined slightly </blockquote>Thanks for your contribution.  However I have to point out, you seem to have your denier memes mixed up. <a href=""http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1999/to:2015/plot/gistemp/from:1999/to:2015/trend"" rel=""nofollow"">As this clearly shows. </a> It is not 1999 but 1998 you are supposed to seeth about, the strongest el Nino ever recorded.Yes the proof there is no warming as that we are now as warm as a super el Nino of only 16 year ago.  Please keep contributing with your fun filled facts.

Comment 10: Actually we aren't as warm this year as in 1998.  However, why can't we all get along? After all we're debating over 5/100ths to 1/10th of a degree centigrade, as well as which reference we use, and where we start measuring with those pesky rulers and graph inclinometers.  For example, here where I live in Spain the temperature has been dropping over the last 10 years. However, if we use the whole Northern Hemisphere (like the controversial Michael Mann did in ""False Hope""), then we can conclude it's going up. But if we point out the region that's really increasing a lot is poleward of 60 degrees north latitude then the Norwegians and Alaskans may shout with glee and thank those warmer days they are seeing.  So I guess it's all relative to which ruler you use. I like to look at the total system energy. That one seems to be going up slightly, but the rate of increase sure has me stumped, its much lower than the figures I see published by the IPCC. Which makes me wonder why they don't come close to agreement. I'm working on that.

Comment 11: <blockquote>  I drove nine hundred miles up and down from Northumberland to Cornwall last week, passing by hundreds of giant stationary wind mills on the way. </blockquote>  But ignoring the moving ones, by the sounds of it. And then there are the ones at sea.

Comment 12: Long winded and nothing but vague anecdotes.

Comment 13: It's a technical seminar. I realize the material is a bit boring even if most readers can't absorb it. I mean it for the guardian staff. Consider it a public service.

Comment 14: perhaps you need to be in touch with the reality of methane emissions from fracking.Perhaps you need to be aware of the reality that all our needs can be met from renewable energy without the need for the myth of bridging fuel form fracking, if only the billions of pounds of tax breaks for dirty fossil fuels were stopped and planning control was to permit large scale renewables withou Eric Pickles interferring from his own agenda.This is addiction to fossil fuels and your masters are spinning us all a junkies tale which is crumbling like the pack of cards it is.

We usually associate stories on fracking that appear in the Guardian with green-ideologically motivated anti-fracking scaremongering, not the reporting of rational risk assessments by bodies that know what they are talking about like the BGS. Let's hope that the UK now moves full speed ahead with fracking, as the quickest way of cutting CO2 emissions and retiring our aging fleet of 1960s and 70s fleet of coal fired power stations as cheaper gas prices reopen the mothballed gas fired plant.

'...Said she would bring forward draft regulations by the end of [April]...This will finally happen on Thursday...there will be a further, short public consultation followed by negotiations with the EU...' To me that sounds like, 'we'll kick it back into the long grass and await some more substantial donations to OldCon party funds from the Baccy Barons.' Cynical of me? Yes, but I could never hope to emulate the cynicism of governments.

Comment 3: I can;t wait, the plain packaging looks so cool, and i think it will encourage people to return to the days of stylish cigarette tins. Much better than advertising a brand when you smoke.

Comment 4: Do we still believe that people start smoking because of the packet? All that does is influence people into which brand they smoke, not whether they start smoking or not.  I think that they've made the cigarette box into an iconic item today. It's a plain white box ffs, you couldn't make it look cooler if you tried.

Comment 5: You're not really the target for measures taken to deglamorize tobacco as a product, though: new smokers are. And the data from Australia point to a drop in sales after this measure, which, alongside the industry trying to block it wherever it's been suggested, rather suggests it might be a good idea.

Comment 6: What has this got to do with why you buy tobacco? You're smoking to fulfill the nicotine addiction and whatever other needs it fulfills. This is just one more thing to make cigs less appealing to kids in the first place.

Comment 7: 'Hasn't smoking in Australia increased...?' No, not according to any independent statistics. Instead, it's reduced.

I used to smoke. Before I gave up completely the only time I stopped was when I was unemployed and couldn't afford anything better than Drum.

Comment 4: <blockquote>  But if that's true, then the manufacturers have nothing to fear, as the marvellousness of their product will burn through, regardless of what it is sold in. </blockquote>  Jesus christ, not that stupid argument again. This is about brand separation, not overall consumption. You think Coca-Cola and Pepsi would be content to see branding removed from their cans, so long as overall consumption accross all cola brands remains stable? People will just start consuming more of the cheaper cola products. The same outcome is likely with tobacco.

Comment 5: If cigarettes go up to &#163;20 a packet it would encourage smuggling, surely? I, for example, am a smoker. I live in Spain. This month I'm going to the UK for a month. I am taking enough cigarettes for the month. Colleagues of mine who don't smoke will take several cartons to sell. They can make enough profit to pay for the trip. Making cigarettes more expensive will encourage them, not discourage them at all.

Comment 6: Exactly. Cigarettes are attractive in and of themselves. It's not the packaging that convinces people to start. Many won't even be aware of which brand of fags they first tried. The packaging is intended to differentiate between brands.

Comment 7: They have the fear of existing smokers not choosing their product/switiching brands as they can't identify the difference visually. That's a completely different issue to people choosing to start to smoke because there is some kind of branding on the pack. So it's about market share.

It's to reduce if as much as is reasonably possible. So if there is smuggling, then so what? Nobody is going to acquire a 20 a day habit for 50 years of his adult life on smuggled tobacco. It simply won't be possible.

It is the theory that the experiences undergone by boys at the great public schools are so intense as to dominate their lives and to arrest their development.    </blockquote>    When you read the second sentence in this passage, your natural impulse is to look for the misprint. Presumably there is a 'not' left out, or something. But no, not a bit of it! He means it! And what is more, he is merely speaking the truth, in an inverted fashion.

Comment 1: McDonalds is a killer product and it is misleading for it to be presented in glitzy packaging. Every day of delay allows the fast food industry to tempt more young people into adopting a deadly habit. If we're going to continue to baby the nation then lets go down this road with everything?

Comment 2: Having McDonalds now and again is fine - even fast food has nutritional value. There are no circumstance in which smoking tabs is anything but bad for you... ...and I know some people really really like burgers but I don't think many of them have 20 a day.

Comment 3: They're not comparable, Maccie Ds isn't a killer product and it doesn't kill half of its customers. Someone who ate a McDonalds burger every day but who exercised and still got the full quota of fruit and veg would unlikely be doing themselves long term damage, wheras half of smokers who smoke an average amount of tobacco will die from it.

Comment 4: You haven't been to a macdonalds in quite a while have you? Glitzy packaging?

Comment 5: 'Baby the nation'? Have you any idea how large the advertising industry is in this country and have you any idea of how much the Tobacco industry spend on advertising? Sure big food needs to be tackled but shouldn't we allow the public to come to their own conclusions in an environment unpolluted by the mixed messages conjured by marketers? The tobacco industry has been especially cynical in this regard and to see the introduction of plain packaging as 'Babying' is to misunderstand the relationship between the tobacco industry and its hosts.

64,Smoking is not as bad for health as diesel fumes.,"Main topic: Smoking is not as bad for health as diesel fumes.

Comment 1: I tend to find i buy tobacco for how it smokes not the packet it comes in. Just another waste of money by the government pretending they care about your health while all the time allowing diesel to be burned in cars knowing that it's diesel that is causing lung cancer.

Comment 2: But if that's true, then the manufacturers have nothing to fear, as the marvellousness of their product will burn through, regardless of what it is sold in.

Comment 3: Diesel from 10 or 20 years ago yes not anymore. I drive a diesel it is exempt from the congestion charge and emits less co2 than many petrol cars. Check the facts.

Comment 4: knowing that it's diesel that is causing lung cancer. Do you work for a tobacco company? There is plenty of evidence which supports cigarettes being one the main causes of various lung diseases, including lung cancer.

Comment 5: Well, you might not understand it, but the tobacco companies certainly do, which is why they've fought so hard against plain packaging.

Comment 6: What has this got to do with why you buy tobacco? You're smoking to fulfill the nicotine addiction and whatever other needs it fulfills. This is just one more thing to make cigs less appealing to kids in the first place.

Comment 7: <blockquote>  Just another waste of money by the government... </blockquote>  Legislators aren't on zero-hours contracts, you know. They get paid the same whether they're passing socially-useful legislation or not. Or did you think the government is offering to package the tobacco companies' products in plain boxes at taxpayer expense?

Comment 8: CO2 isn't directly damaging to human health, PM and NOx (emitted by diesel vehicles) are. I'm happy you enjoy your diesel car, but don't believe that recent improvements in diesel quality make its emissions clean. It's obvious that ciggs are worse for you than London air, but Londoners don't have a choice about breathing the air.

Comment 9: <blockquote>  Diesel from 10 or 20 years ago yes not anymore. I drive a diesel it is exempt from the congestion charge and emits less co2 than many petrol cars. Check the facts. </blockquote>  I don't think it is the CO2 that gives you lung cancer. It is harmless. Check you facts

Comment 10: <blockquote>  But if that's true, then the manufacturers have nothing to fear, as the marvellousness of their product will burn through, regardless of what it is sold in. </blockquote>... and indeed that may be the case. However the concern is that instead of working, or not working, it may actually result in a small increase in smoking and there is (highly disputed) evidence that may be the case.  <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/australian-medical-association-accuses-the-australian-of-promoting-smoking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/australian-medical-association-accuses-the-australian-of-promoting-smoking</a> All this is just tinkering around the edges. The single biggest factor in people giving up smoking, or cutting down, is price. If the government is serious about reducing smoking they should be increasing the tax. Smugglers and trips to France simply could not compete with the demand generated if a packet of 20 was priced at £20. People would smoke less, many would stop. I speak from experience. I used to smoke. Before I gave up completely the only time I stopped was when I was unemployed and couldn't afford anything better than Drum.

Comment 11: But it keeps the spiteful ones happy. Hasn't smoking increased in Australia since it was introduced? Same people are no doubt happy to add to the alcohol related damage figures and will be squealing for liver transplants shortly at vast taxpayer expense without having paid the taxes smokers did. Will be so nice watching all non-smokers taxes rise to cover the nhs for their disgusting habits - street vomiters all.

Comment 12: 'Hasn't smoking in Australia increased...?' No, not according to any independent statistics. Instead, it's reduced.

Comment 13: <blockquote>  Diesel from 10 or 20 years ago yes not anymore. I drive a diesel it is exempt from the congestion charge and emits less co2 than many petrol cars. Check the facts. </blockquote>  It's not the CO2 that's carcinogenic you dunce: it's the particulates and NOX. Check the facts...

Comment 14: <blockquote>  But if that's true, then the manufacturers have nothing to fear, as the marvellousness of their product will burn through, regardless of what it is sold in. </blockquote>  Jesus christ, not that stupid argument again. This is about brand separation, not overall consumption. You think Coca-Cola and Pepsi would be content to see branding removed from their cans, so long as overall consumption accross all cola brands remains stable? People will just start consuming more of the cheaper cola products. The same outcome is likely with tobacco.

Comment 15: Sales of tobacco per person in Australia have continued to decline since plain packaging was introduced. See the Guardian's own <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/2014/jun/06/is-smoking-increasing-in-australia"" rel=""nofollow"">Datablog</a> for details.

Comment 16: That's what you think...

Comment 17: Not heard of the diesel filter all cars must have?

Comment 18: If cigarettes go up to &#163;20 a packet it would encourage smuggling, surely? I, for example, am a smoker. I live in Spain. This month I'm going to the UK for a month. I am taking enough cigarettes for the month. Colleagues of mine who don't smoke will take several cartons to sell. They can make enough profit to pay for the trip. Making cigarettes more expensive will encourage them, not discourage them at all.

Comment 19: Exactly. Cigarettes are attractive in and of themselves. It's not the packaging that convinces people to start. Many won't even be aware of which brand of fags they first tried. The packaging is intended to differentiate between brands.

Comment 20: They have the fear of existing smokers not choosing their product/switiching brands as they can't identify the difference visually. That's a completely different issue to people choosing to start to smoke because there is some kind of branding on the pack. So it's about market share.

Comment 21: No it hasn't, it's decreased...The Australian (Murdoch rag) ran a story saying it had increased but was then found out to be using the wrong data (http://thekouk.com/blog/the-abs-confirms-tobacco-consumption-is-falling.html#.U6w8JMtZo_w).. Murdoch will do anything to discredit the last Labor govt and he has ties to big tobacco http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/donald-gutstein/2011/07/murdoch%E2%80%99s-ties-big-tobacco

Comment 22: the main cause of cancer is wheat but i guess you won't know anything about that.

Comment 23: Snap!

Comment 24: My mother, otherwise perfectly intelligent, is adamant that the asthma all her children suffer from was caused by artificial addictives in orange squash. Apparently she read it somewhere. She has a scientific background. Both she and her husband smoked very heavily for years (he still does) but apparently this had nothing at all to do with the development of asthma. Denial is a wondrous thing. So is clean air.

Comment 25: CO2 isn't the problem with diesel emissions, it's the tiny, lung penetrating particulates that are the problem. They cause irritation, can lead to COPD and thence cancer.

Comment 26: Yeah, yeah, you can try all the whattabouttery you like visavis diesel fumes, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and other rare causes, but the fact is that 80-90% of COPD cases are caused by smoking. http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/copd/about-copd/understanding-copd.html

Comment 27: Agreed, it would encourage smuggling. But no matter how much smuggling takes place you cannot smuggle enough into the UK to support anything like its current cigarette consumption. You can hide enough heroin in the body of a car to support hundreds of users for a year. To do that with cigarettes you would need a supertanker. The aim here is not to reduce smoking to zero. It's to reduce if as much as is reasonably possible. So if there is smuggling, then so what? Nobody is going to acquire a 20 a day habit for 50 years of his adult life on smuggled tobacco. It simply won't be possible.

Comment 28: It depends on the type of cancer, but I guess you wouldn't know about that? For example wheat is associated with stomach cancer and smoking with lung cancer. It also depends on the country you live which be can affected by a number of different factors, including lifestyle.  I only lost my grandfather and uncle to lung cancer, 2 heavy smokers, but I guess I know nothing about smokings effect on people?

65,Tesco is a greedy corporation.,"Main topic: Tesco is a greedy corporation.

Comment 1: What's the bet that a Tescos 'local' will be the only shop allowed in the vicinity.

Comment 2: Let's not forget they're selling the land at the peak of this housing bubble. That means they're maximizing profit  Hardly altruistic. Unless you've heard any news of Donations to community build projects?

Comment 3: ....this is not altruism...this a business opportunity for greedy grocers keen to shore up their dimishing returns ( mostly lost to the big discounters Aldi etc )

Comment 4: Or maybe a sign that market forces can sometimes work ?  Not always, of course. Now, how much tax does Aldi pay ? In the UK or Germany, where it is based ? It is privately owned by the hereditary heir via an opaque ""notionally"" charitable company.

Comment 5: So......far better that they left the land undeveloped? What's your point? Were you here last week when we were all complaining that Tesco were sat on a landbank that could be used for desperately needed new homes? We've got what we wanted last week, they've got what they want (a return on their investment) - and you see this as an opportunity to complain?? Which altruistic company were you hoping they would follow the example of?

Comment 6: You don't have to look very far: <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10343012/Aldi-posts-record-profits-as-the-alternative-to-the-Big-Four.html"" rel=""nofollow"">From the Telegraph, 30th September 2013:</a>  <blockquote>  In 2012, Aldi paid £30m in tax in the UK and the new accounts show it will pay £45.3m on the back of the company's record financial results. </blockquote>

Comment 9: If you bothered to click on the link provided that information is there. £157.9m.

Comment 10: Posting from a smartphone and this app won't allow the links to work. It's not that big a deal to ask people to give full relevant details on their posts is it? But you get snotty about it.

Comment 11: Add in the fact that their staff all pay more tax because they are all better paid and it is win-win for the UK economy.

Comment 12: the point for me is why are they allowed to build up land stock to such levels? where is the safe guard against this hoarding which when they finally use it usefully, we are supposed to be grateful for...the local govt is their pockets...

Comment 14: Take it you missed last weeks ""whinge about Tesco"" story? (a justifiable one i might add, although there were bigger targets). This is exactly what we were all screaming for.

Comment 15: You love corporations that overcharge us and then keep their profits til they're forced to reinvest it into the community.

Comment 16: I'm not saying I love them - but there is something about 'hating' them for the right reasons. Overcharged us? How much should a tin of beans cost then? I've been happy with the price of a tin of beans I've bought from all of the big supermarkets. They've all taken the route of small profits from lots of customers, instead of bigger profits from a smaller number of customers. Are you suggesting that you want them to offer certain products at cost, or below cost in order to lower their total profits? Because then you'll only end up shrinking the market into their hands further - independents certainly won't be able to compete, and the likes of Aldi and Lidl would probably think twice about entering such a market. I get the feeling that a market completely cornered by Tesco though isn't what you want? The point is they are doing what we wanted, whether we forced them or not, and yet you still seem to be complaining.

Comment 1: Tesco taking a step in the right direction? No, they know their stores are no longer wanted, and it is an opportunity to make a lot of money. Soon other stores will follow. Large out of town shopping will get less and less popular because of internet shopping and high fuel prices. I always shop on line for most things. I may have a walk into town occasionally, but more to buy fresh produce on the market or meet friends for coffee or lunch.

Comment 2: and they had stock piled land!! Who is defending Tesco?

67,The housing crisis is due to immigration.,"Main topic: The housing crisis is due to immigration.

Comment 1: Housing crisis will always exist if Labour allows open door policy and please don't anyone tell me it doesn't affect the housing needs.

Comment 2: Or if private companies (especially the house builders) continue to sit on the land and not develop it. The increasing housing needs could be comfortably met, but these companies have a financial interest in keeping supply tight, and of course politicians are more interested in the corporate wellbeing than the citizen's. To make sure you don't blame them they've spun some narrative that it's that nasty old foreigner coming over here and you've fallen for it. If there was the political will this could be solved.

Comment 3: Average net immigration during 13 years of Labour = 192,000. Average net immigration last 4 years of Cameron? 198,000. Door/hinges disaster hits UK?

Comment 4: Several reasons (may be): 1. Life wasn't as good under Labour as made out to be.2. Most Eastern EU countries citizens are now allowed to enter Western Europe3. Border control not effective here4. Life becoming more difficult in non-EU countries.5. No effective border controls in EU countries like Italy and especially France.6. Lucrative human trafficking. And many more.....

Comment 5: It is not for private enterprise to dictate how we all live. While private enterprise is brilliant at invention and initiative it has to be kept in bounds else its natural impetus would dictate that everything must be useful else abandoned.  When you consider that some Continentals living here do not understand the concept of ducks, geese and swans as ornamental adornment, in their eyes it is food and bountifully provided, just waiting to be culled. This is the metaphor for industry. It knows no bounds; it is active and grinding and figures rather than pictures are relevant, the marks of success and the guide to the individual's competence.  If there were no rules at all, if nature is but a hindrance, if trees are just weeds and water courses inconveniences, then Britain would be just some sort of builder's yard. In the past we have seen that a balance can be obtained. But such balance is only imposed if we are in control and ahead of the game. Today we do not feel that such management is available and even if local rules forbid it then the appeal to the state will find favourable responses on merely scientific terms, measures, the reliance on fact rather than any sort of romance or quirk. Today, even if the State intervenes, there is a higher authority and not God to resort to. The EU is but a fact mountain and its difference has little understanding of Britain and its ways (it never has had), only some general, fabricated case of pan-Europeanism.  It is that thing about the search for fuel resource in a desert: pretty soon not only have you scoured the land and emptied it of the obvious fuel, the dead branches, the cow pats et al, you soon start to uproot the living stuff, the shade, the future resource, the sustenance of creatures. Pretty soon, where you started with a living desert you have a dead desert. In Britain the massive requirement of the unaffordable state has used up all the actual resource and is now setting about the fundamentals of the reflective mind, playing with our cognitive well-being by stripping away our expanse of breathing space and confining us to more and ever more claustrophobic environments. Stripping what was adornment and the unemployed, be it woodland, animals, birds, streams, aspects, our retreats and hiding places, our succour and subliminal necessity.  It is not Tesco that determines our futures. They do not determine who we are and what we aspire too. They are just another element greedy for their own place, their own survival, much in the manner of weeds. If not addressed they will rob the environment of the fruitful and needful but on their own narrow terms.

Comment 6: I've some latest news for you Labour haven't been in government for over 4 years. You are now allowed to change the sodding record

Comment 7: You mean all the balls up can be changed in just 4 years especially when there was no money left. I suggest you change your sodding records about 4 years.

Comment 8: You really do lap up everything they tell you don't you? There is plenty of money. We've had an Olympics, wars, trident renewed, tax breaks for the wealthy, a railway line to trim 20 mins off a journey, major overhauls of the NHS and education, Royal Mail sold for a lot less than its value, the privatisation of profit and the socialising of debt. Where do we rank in the worlds richest nations? Top 7 or 8?? There is more than enough money, they just don't want to spend it on you. What better way than conjure up the hated boogeyman from overseas to distract you from who is really screwing you over and its a white middle aged man from the Uk.

Comment 9: the point for me is why are they allowed to build up land stock to such levels? where is the safe guard against this hoarding which when they finally use it usefully, we are supposed to be grateful for...the local govt is their pockets...

68,New build houses are either too expensive or too small.,"Main topic: New build houses are either too expensive or too small.

Comment 1: I think we guarantee these places will be typical new builds which will mean no driveway, small, cramped roads and a postage stamp sized back garden.

Comment 2: And if they built them with spacious rooms, driveways, and large gardens you'd complain about the prices.

Comment 3: Have you seen house prices lately? They need to be affordable apartments with shared gardens able to house much more than the typical English style home does.

Comment 4: They'll need to be the sort of homes that people in the area want. Other than that, I agree totally. I live in London, no personal garden (just a patio which was a 42 centigrade death trap today) but with a public garden to which I have access (via an increased council tax). It wouldn't work well for a keen gardener, who would take pleasure from planning and growing things. But it works really well. Meet the neighbours. And we also have a few BBQs per year. Costs about me £80 per annum. And is managed by residents.

Comment 5: Oh for goodness sake you sound like my father, expecting the worse even before they have put a spade to the ground works. At least they are taking a step in the right direction. You are damned if you do and damned if you don't in this country, to the point where I am sure there are a good many people who just ask themselves, why bother!

Comment 6: Absolutely not, kind sir. I grew up in an ex council house so appreciate large rooms, having a drive way and a good garden. The house prices will be set by the market, my gripe is that housing in this country is getting smaller and smaller. If people want to live in hobbit homes, that's their business.

Comment 7: Tesco aren't doing this for altruistic reasons, they're doing it because their business model is starting to wobble as people's spending habits and preference of supermarket are changing.  My complaint is general one: housing in this country is getting smaller, we should be like the Dutch!

Comment 8: <blockquote>  they're doing it because their business model is starting to wobble as people's spending habits and preference of supermarket are changing. </blockquote>  Be that as it may, it's probably a lot to do with boosting their bottom line as well, but at least they are going the right way about doing it, because it will help with the lack of housing in this country, so regardless of their reasons I for one will look at the positive side of it, until I hear they have altered their minds about it.  As for the size of houses, I agree with you completely, but even a small yard can become a beautiful outdoor space with a little imagination and research, after all most veggies can be grown in pots now and I think they look lovely as they are growing.  On the other hand having communal spaces may just help to get that feeling of community back as everyone within the area without their own outdoor spaces congregate on them.  As a country we need to learn to look at the good in something (where possible) instead of just focusing on the bad.

Comment 9: What's the bet that a Tescos 'local' will be the only shop allowed in the vicinity.

Comment 10: Rooms getting smaller is a problem. It should be a legal requirement that housing particulars include the price per sq metre. A lack of gardens and parking spaces isn't a problem in urban areas. In inner London boroughs car ownership is often less than 50% as you rarely need one.

Comment 11: Yes, they should just keep the land undeveloped as so many of us were complaining about a week ago. That would be far more preferable.

Comment 12: Your garden sounds great. It makes sense as the local residents who take a keen interest in gardening can indulge and get a bit of cash off the council (???) and those that would normally have a backyard of overgrown weeds still get to enjoy a well kept outdoor space. I know what you mean but I'm sure that everyone in the area wants a 4 bedroom house with a half acre garden but with the crazy prices in the SE, this isn't possible anymore. There seems to be a serious gap in the affordable range of housing. Thanks to 1970's council flats, British people seem to be scarred mentally when it comes to apartments. I'm not suggesting they build high-rises but a development with affordable apartments for young people wanting to buy a place seems to be well needed right about now.

Comment 13: I agree that people should get to live in large spacious places but unless the price of property in the UK - especially the SE - is literally halved, I don;t see any alternative.

Comment 14: Apartments == overcrowded streets.

Comment 15: Apartments = bustling, thriving high streets.

Comment 16: <blockquote>  They need to be affordable apartments with shared gardens able to house much more than the typical English style home does. </blockquote>  So much for this green and pleasant land.  Most back yard developments I see these days mean populated areas are moving more towards the slums of Mumbai than anything else. Mutually assured squalor.

Comment 17: Tesco taking a step in the right direction? No, they know their stores are no longer wanted, and it is an opportunity to make a lot of money. Soon other stores will follow. Large out of town shopping will get less and less popular because of internet shopping and high fuel prices. I always shop on line for most things. I may have a walk into town occasionally, but more to buy fresh produce on the market or meet friends for coffee or lunch.

Comment 18: and they had stock piled land!! Who is defending Tesco? I wonder if the fact they stockpiled land (for how long?) impacted in any way on the fact there was less land for other people to build new houses, fuelling the housing crisis and therefore forcing prices up? Tesco = the evil empire..

Comment 19: <blockquote>  As a country we need to learn to look at the good in something (where possible) instead of just focusing on the bad </blockquote>  Even better if if the bad is eliminated, isn't it?  Britain has the smallest houses in Europe, and shrinking. Many homes are build on the principle ""minimum spending, maximum profit"". As a result the end product is often sloppy, insufficient or even inadequate. Many new builds simply are made just to meet the minimum legal requirements. No ambition there from developers whatsoever. No ambitious insulation, just the bare minimum. Bathrooms and kitchens are minimally tiled or not at all sometimes. Adequate storage space is a rarity especially in apartments. 2nd and 3rd bedrooms provide just enough space to spread your arms. I could go on for ages but the conclusion is that the only ambition from developers is maximum profit , and this is  <blockquote>  standard practice </blockquote>.The final price is a ""bargain"" but the real joy comes when you realize how ""great"" leasehold tenure is if a flat is what you could afford :)  By all means, do carry on feeling positive about Tesco's initiative. I'm sure they're not the greedy type. Any home is better than nothing, even a cave. After all, living under a bridge is preferable to living under nothing, right? Let's just lighten up and... be positive! There is so much to be positive about the British housing of today! :S Give me a break.

Comment 20: I don't want greenbelt land to be built on and I don't know anyone that wants to concrete over the countryside.

Everyone will continue to be greedy with profits and lazy with workmanship while ever someone is willing to pay the price.

If Tesco build shitty shoe boxes, instead of people flocking to buy them so they can get on the ""oh so brilliant property ladder"" they should turn their backs on them, doubt it will happen though.....

Comment 24: <blockquote>  If people want larger houses then why do they keep buying smaller ones? </blockquote>  Because that's all they can afford.  <blockquote>  If they want more storage why buy houses/apartments without any </blockquote>  Same reason. See above.  <blockquote>  and stand up for what we want instead of accepting everything that is thrown at us and then having a bloody good whine about it. </blockquote>  For many people the only choice they have is a small, inadequate flat or not owning at all. Considering prices in London, some would need 2-3 lives in order to be able to save for a family home.  <blockquote>  people flocking to buy them so they can get on the ""oh so brilliant property ladder"" </blockquote>  Owning your own place is a basic human instinct; it provides a deep sense of belonging that contrubutes significantly to people's well-being. What you're suggesting is ""keep saving and wait till you can buy what you want and stop moaning"". Basically for many in London that would mean to save until retirement and only then if they're lucky. Some people on minimum income wouldn't be able to buy a decent home no matter how long they'd save.  As you can see, there are genuine reasons for a ""a bloody good whine about it"".

Comment 25: <blockquote>  Owning your own place is a basic human instinct; </blockquote> what a silly comment that is.

I rest my case that until we as a nation make a stand and stop buying things that don't meet our requirements, just because we ""must have them"" nothing will change.

Which altruistic company were you hoping they would follow the example of?

Comment 19: Take it you missed last weeks ""whinge about Tesco"" story? (a justifiable one i might add, although there were bigger targets). This is exactly what we were all screaming for.

Comment 20: Sorry I need this spelling out for me. I sense that you're whinging but I'm struggling to see what the complaint is. Tesco made money by selling us something we wanted. They bought land with the money and are now building things that we want on it (houses) instead of the things we don't want (more Tescos)??? And your problem is? I know there's that bit about councils building homes on the land, but which council are you thinking of that has got a land buying policy that has lost out to private enterprise? Which council is building new homes? Isn't the important point that the homes are being built? Yes, I'd prefer Santa was building them but its not realistic to imagine that is going to happen.

Comment 21: You love corporations that overcharge us and then keep their profits til they're forced to reinvest it into the community.

Comment 22: I'm not saying I love them - but there is something about 'hating' them for the right reasons. Overcharged us? How much should a tin of beans cost then? I've been happy with the price of a tin of beans I've bought from all of the big supermarkets. They've all taken the route of small profits from lots of customers, instead of bigger profits from a smaller number of customers. Are you suggesting that you want them to offer certain products at cost, or below cost in order to lower their total profits? Because then you'll only end up shrinking the market into their hands further - independents certainly won't be able to compete, and the likes of Aldi and Lidl would probably think twice about entering such a market. I get the feeling that a market completely cornered by Tesco though isn't what you want? The point is they are doing what we wanted, whether we forced them or not, and yet you still seem to be complaining. I'll repeat my original question - exactly what is it that you're not happy about??

Comment 23: <blockquote>  Tesco made money by selling us something we wanted. </blockquote>  Yes those horse meat burgers were delicious, you can't get those in Waitrose.

Comment 25: Seems a simple business decision. Tesco have land which, with changing requirements, they no longer need. How can they get a good price for it - sell it as house building development. Also gives beneficial publicity as helping to relieve well known housing shortage. What's the problem?

Comment 26: They aren't offering these to the staff they have on low wages.

Comment 27: I assume the properties will be for sale on the open market in which case they will be available to Tesco employees also. Of course they will need to obtain a mortgage like the rest of us.

Comment 28: Which on wages like that will be impossible.

Comment 29: Wages like what?

Comment 30: They aren't offering these to the staff they have on low wages Since they aren't built you don't know that they won't - but why should they?

Comment 31: Go back to the story last week, there's a link to it in the article above. Everyone was demanding Tesco build homes, and now.......post after post of people whining about Tesco's homebuilding plan. Would you prefer they left it undeveloped?

Comment 32: Don't move there. Will that stop the whining?

","Comment 1 (supports Main topic): tesco are taking a step in the right direction, stop complaining

Comment 2 (attacks Comment 1): no, tesco are not doing this for good reasons, but because they're business model is wobbling. housing is getting smaller, we should be like the dutch

Comment 3 (attacks Comment 2): agrees it may be selfish, but tesco are going the right way about it by helping people with lack of housing. agrees housing is getting smaller but sees beauty in a small yard

Comment 4 (supports Main topic): sarcastically says tesco should leave the land undeveloped.; implies people do not want that

Comment 5 (attacks Comment 1): tesco is no longer wanted and they just want to make lots of money. sees other stores following suit and decline of shopping in supermarkets due to internet shopping and high petrol costs. shops online often.

Comment 6 (attacks Comment 5): tesco is the evil empire, wonders if tesco's stockpiling of land fuelled the housing crisis and forced prices up

Comment 7 (attacks Comment 3): britain has smallest houses in europe. many new builds meet minimum legal requirements. says any home is better than nothing

Comment 8 (attacks Comment 4): no concrete over the countryside. get rid of the greenbelt land and see the quality of life in the country plummet

Comment 9 (attacks Comment 3): they're maximising profit, tesco are selfish. is there any news of donations to community projects?

Comment 10 (attacks Comment 8): no need for cries over the environment, the article on mentions a disused factory. homes are much needed.

Comment 11 (attacks Comment 7): why do people who want larger houses keep buying smaller ones? people need to decide whether the wait for the right property for them is better than settling for any property even if not suited to their needs. stop accepting things that are thrown at us.

Comment 12 (attacks Comment 11): people can only afford small houses, they why they buy them. owning your own place is a basic instinct

Comment 13 (attacks Comment 12): some people have never had any instinct to own their own place. nation must make a stand and stop buying things that don't meed requirements

Comment 14 (attacks Comment 13): it is silly to deny human territoriality

Comment 15 (attacks Comment 14): talk of instinct and territoriality is nonsense

Comment 16 (attacks Comment 15): yes humans mark territories, on walls and fences especially

Comment 17 (supports Main topic): it is much better than they leave the land undeveloped. public gets; what they want and tesco get what they want.  people were complaining about tesco last week

Comment 18 (attacks Comment 17): why are tesco allowed to build up land to such levels? where is the safeguarding?

Comment 19 (supports Main topic): the houses is what people wanted after last issue with tesco

Comment 20 (supports Main topic): they bought land with the money from selling us what we wanted and; are now building things that we want on it (houses) instead of the things we don't want (more tescos); what is the problem? doesn't matter who is building homes as long as they are getting built

Comment 21 (attacks Comment 20): implies tesco is a corporation that 'overcharge us and then keep their profits til they're forced to reinvest it into the community.' tesco are selfish

Comment 22 (attacks Comment 21): people should 'hate' them for the right reasons. they've all taken the route of small profits from lots of customers, instead of bigger profits from a smaller number of customers. they are doing what we wanted, whether we forced them or not.

Comment 23 (attacks Comment 20): joke about horsemeat burgers from tesco

Comment 24 (attacks Comment 21): free will means you don't have to shop where you don't want to

Comment 25 (attacks Main topic): good business decision for tesco, what is the problem? good price for selling; as house building development, good publicity.

Comment 26 (attacks Comment 25): complaint on staff's low wages, should give houses to them

Comment 27 (attacks Comment 26): tesco employees can buy the homes too, with a mortgage

Comment 28 (attacks Comment 27): impossible to get mortgages on their wages

Comment 6: Maybe they could build decent, affordable rented homes for their underpaid staff who currently rely on housing benefit and tax credits to get by.

Comment 7: Extremely unlikely. Tesco is a giant business, not a charity. Britain is awash with workers who are desperate for paid work. Tesco can pick them off like cherries from a tree. In 19th century Britain there were a few employers who concerned themselves with the out of work lives of their employees, but this is the 21st century. Why would Tesco do anything that might compromise its profits?

Comment 8: There is no supermarket that pays it's staff enough. Tesco is just one of many.

Comment 9: They all pay their staff enough i.e, enough to attract & retain the quality & quantity of staff that they deem necessary. Why would a business do otherwise?

Comment 10: Tesco could build workhouses for their employees and pay them in tokens, to be spent in local shop. That's the spirit of the times!
