20,Network Rail is to blame for increased train ticket prices.,"Main topic: Network Rail is to blame for increased train ticket prices.

Comment 1: what about having a word with them about ticket prices aswell?

Comment 2: That would be fairly pointless, given that Network Rail don't operate passenger trains!

Comment 3: The fact that the first post is getting recommends shows that there are some clueless people out there! If you are going to criticise the railways (I do so fairly often), then at least read up on how they actually work! Criticising from from a position of complete ignorance won't gain you any credibility! Passenger trains are not operated by Network Rail (their remit is solely to maintain the railway infrastructure), therefore the ticket prices are nothing to do with them!

Comment 4: silly me, of course I forgot that network rail provide their services to rail operators completely free and have nothing whatsoever to do with increasing ticket prices d'oh

Comment 5: Network Rail don't have anything to do with ticket prices.

Comment 6: Yes, silly you! The fact that operators pay a cost to Network Rail for track access is beside the point. NR's funding is all set by the government, and they (NR) have absolutely no say in ticket prices - those are set by the train operators within a framework of restrictions set by the government. If you want to complain about ticket prices (which is certainly a fair complaint in many cases) the people to complain to are the passenger operators and the government. To use another transport analogy, complaining to Network Rail about ticket prices would be like complaining to a dock company about the price of an electronic item which happened to be imported through their facilities.

Comment 7: Not really - it just shows how demented train privatisation is

Comment 8: So as far as the TOCs are concerned, Network Rail operate in a vacuum & what it charges those companies for track space is not partly reflected in the fares charged?

Comment 9: Only to the same extent that anything you buy will include its transport costs! But the original poster was suggesting complaining to Network Rail about ticket prices. A lot of people seem to have trouble understanding that this would be completely pointless as Network Rail have no influence over ticket prices. Is this really so difficult to understand?

Comment 10: It is symptomatic of how ridiculously fractured our rail system is however. It isn't an unreasonable assumption to think the same company or institution was responsible for both fares and punctuality. Yesterday at St. Pancras I became alarmed when the last train to Canterbury didn't show on the national departure board - because I assumed that all national trains would be listed together for passenger convenience. But know separate companies had departures on desperate boards. Crazy. Choice is bullshit - passengers just want a reliable service. Bring back British Rail or something like it.

Comment 11: Don't be a smart arse mate. The point they're trying to make is that ticket price is more important then delays

Comment 12: They are making it in the wrong place, then! How many times does it have to be repeated that Network Rail have no role in setting ticket prices? Some people seem incapable of understanding!

Comment 13: So up go the fares again? I don't see them paying out of their profits, they'll just pass that on to the TOCs, who will pass it on to passengers.

Comment 14: Network Rail are a non-profit public body, so they don't have any profits. Any income either gets ploughed back in to the rail network or goes to the government.

Comment 15: Network Rail are a non-profit public body, so they don't have any profits. Any income either gets ploughed back in to the rail network or goes to the government. No, in fact Network Rail is set up as a ""not for dividend"" private company limited by guarantee; not a non profit making company!

Comment 16: Technically, yes - but the effect is the same - it was only done like this to keep the debt off the public accounts! It changes in September anyway, when it officially becomes a public body.

Comment 17: <blockquote>  No, in fact Network Rail is set up as a ""not for dividend"" private company limited by guarantee; not a non profit making company! </blockquote>  Its a public company. The ""private"" bit is a deliberate lie. Theres nothing private about it. The taxpayer owns it. The fine is meaningless, as it must get it back in public subsidy, or it ceases to function.

Comment 18: Technically, yes - but the effect is the same - it was only done like this to keep the debt off the public accounts!  We can certainly agree on that. It changes in September anyway, when it officially becomes a public body. Not having kept up to speed on the matter I didn't know that, thanks for the info. Interesting I wonder how that squares with the usual coalition view private = good, public = bad.

Comment 19: The fine is meaningless, as it must get it back in public subsidy, or it ceases to function. Yes I think we can all agree that!

21,"Train Operating Companies are to blame for train delays, not Network Rail.","Main topic: Train Operating Companies are to blame for train delays, not Network Rail.

Comment 1: Don't we (the tax payers) own Network Rail? So how is fining ourselves going to help improve our disfunctional Railways? Nationalisation is the answer with rail prices aligned with those in most of Europe.

Comment 2: Agree 100%.  The TOCs are hardly without fault, either. A bit of disaster recovery planning would do wonders.

Comment 3: exactly - it is the directors who should be collectively fined - fat chance of that happening

Comment 4: Yes we own it and it is more or less fully nationalised already with the process of brining their debts onto the Treasury's books being completed this September. This is not really the solution to any of the problems mentioned here though. The railway doesn't magically start working wonderfully just because someone else owns it. Fares have nothing to do with Network Rail or even much to do with private operators and are everything to do with the level of state support politicians or we as taxpayers are prepared to provide. It has been government policy for many years to reduce the burden on the taxpayer and we are now at the stage where passengers cover operational costs with the taxpayer paying for enhancements. Fining ourselves is somewhat ridiculous and the wifi roll-out is just a way of recycling money back into the industry in some way. At the root of the problem is a much busier railway than 20 years ago which makes it harder to recover from service disruption. British Rail heavily rationalised the network in the 60s, 70s and early 80s and we still live with the legacy of this. We've seen some attempt to fix this on East Coast with the new North Doncaster Chord and the Hitchin Flyover being completed recently. The latter was dreamt up at least 50 years ago. Great Western users are or soon will become aware of major improvements there too.

Comment 5: Dock their pay - after all, it's what IDS does to the unemployed, and ""we're all in it together""!

Comment 6: It's hardly a 'slap' fining a company £50m, when it gets an annual public subsidy of £2.9bn.

Comment 7: Stafford hospital is nationalised and it didn't stop all those deaths. The BBC is nationalised and it didn't stop Savile. And of course those organisations have not been fined £53 million either, even though deaths and child sex abuse are a bit more serious than late trains.

Comment 8: Stafford hospital is nationalised and it didn't stop all those deaths. All those deaths? Haven't you been keeping up with this? The independent report scotched the Daily Mail's scaremongering report, still if it doesn't fit with your prejudices I don't suppose you will want to be convinced.

Comment 9: Fining a public body who's ability to do a good job is dependent (partly) on how much money they have to do it, is counter-productive. Individuals in that public body are relatively uneffected by such fines, so it leaves me wondering exactly in what way is the fine supposed to induce greater effectiveness? But then I'd hardly be the first to question the intelligence of regulators or the people who set them and the mechanisms they operate with, up.

Comment 10: Why wouldn't it be the TOC's that are responsible for punctuality? Aren't they the ones running the trains and staff?

Comment 11: If the trains can't proceed because of signalling issues, overrunning maintenance work or leaves on the line it's infrastructure to blame, not the TOCs.

Comment 12: <blockquote>  FellOffMeChair said:    If the trains can't proceed because of signalling issues, overrunning maintenance work or leaves on the line it's infrastructure to blame, not the TOCs.  </blockquote> Then sack management, withhold bonuses, whatever  Why are we fining a state-owned company?!It's just punishing the end customer all over again

Comment 13: The part of bonuses dependent on train performance have been withheld.

Comment 14: <blockquote>  If the trains can't proceed because of signalling issues, overrunning maintenance work or leaves on the line it's infrastructure to blame, not the TOCs. </blockquote>  Really?? Funny how I seem to get delayed more often than not because there are not the staff to actually run the train, which has little to do with Network rail and everything to do with TOCs trying to cut staff below the level necessary to run the service properly.

Comment 15: <blockquote>  Snapshackle said:  Really??  Funny how I seem to get delayed more often than not because there are not the staff to actually run the train, which has little to do with Network rail and everything to do with TOCs trying to cut staff below the level necessary to run the service properly. </blockquote> Did you get a refund? Were the TOC fined? Interesting if they're allowed to continue business as usual...(!)

Comment 16: There are instances where the TOCs are to blame for sure. But they are out of the scope of this issue. The TOCs will have their own penalties to face when they screw up.

Comment 17: The operator doesn't give a chuff chuff as it's regulators' are choo-choo; we may as well just whistle.

Comment 18: It does seem ridiculous - the private companies that operate each line fail to run on time - despite padding the timetables -yet the taxpayer-funded Network Rail pays the fine? So ordinary people suffer late trains, then ordinary taxpayers have to pay the fine? Our rail system is utterly insane - and everything else (schools, NHS...) seems to be being dragged down the same doomed path.

Comment 1: <blockquote>  Network Rail has also pledged to spend an additional £25m to improve the resilience of the south-east commuter network. </blockquote> The most heavily subsidised rail users in the region getting nearest the targets are given yet more disproportionate subsidy.  Anyone spot any vote buying going on here? Cameron and Osborne have just reneged on their pledges to fund electrification in South Wales. This is just more greed and selfishness from the South East, the tape worm of the UK public sector economy.

Comment 2: It's the same with all government funding - be it transport, arts, or whatever. London and its surrounds always get a disproportionately large slice of the pie!

Comment 3: Are you sure that per capita London is better funded than other parts of the country? I have my doubts.

Comment 4: Yes, just do some searching on the web. There's plenty of information out there!

Comment 5: Right, take money from all rail travellers and give it to the SE commuters.

Comment 6: How will an improved Wifi system speed up train journeys? A: By distracting passengers for longer periods so they don't notice how late their train is running. How will this benefit West country users? A: Not one bit. You can't use any equipment when your arms are pinned to your sides due to over crowded carriages. How will this benefit the rest of the country outside of the pampered South East? A: See west country answer. How will this benefit the train operators and their shareholders? A: Another £53.1m of taxpayers money being loaded into their over laden troughs.

Comment 1: WiFi? WiNot spend the money improving the track and signalling and repairing the ""speed restriction"" areas of the network that made the trains run late?I suppose the one thing the punctuality failure didn`t affect last year was the executives` bonus package.

Comment 2: I don't want the tax paid on my hard work spent on a form of transport I (may) use once a year. Let the operators pay by levying the actual rail users, if they want better services, dig deeper.

Comment 3: <blockquote>  I don't want the tax paid on my hard work spent on a form of transport I (may) use once a year. </blockquote>  Do you drive? I object to subsidising your driving by paying for the roads.

Comment 4: I believe the roads are more than self funded by the road tax and various fuel levies.

Comment 5: 1. There's no such thing as ""road tax"".2. Better rail services mean fewer cars on the roads = less congestion for those who do travel by road.

Comment 6: <blockquote>  I don't want the tax paid on my hard work spent on a form of transport I (may) use once a year. </blockquote>  Why should my taxes pay for the coastguard? I don't own a boat. Why should my taxes pay for the police? I haven't been a victim of crime. Why should my taxes pay for schools? I don't have any kids. etc, etc.

Comment 7: 1. Vehicle Excise Duty then... Great rebuttal there.2. True, I'm not sure who you think argued that wasn't the case?

Comment 8: Rail still carries freight and were the regular users to be forced to adopt alternative modes of travel you, Peter, might find your non rail journey much more difficult.

Comment 10: Why should blind people pay tax for street lighting?

Comment 12: Under that belief no one pays for anything as all tax revenue is pooled then distributed as needed. The point is road tax (are you really that insular that you don't realise the vast majority of people and organisations call it that?) and fuel duty is a greater source of revenue to the exchequer than the expense of maintaining the roads...

Comment 18: We do have 3G and 4G as in they are technologies that exist, but for a lot of train journeys the amount of signal available is extremely limited and often non-existent.

Comment 19: Surely the fine should go on benefitting all those who sere affeccted by lack of punctuality.

Comment 1: I can't see how it won't attract rats and other vermin. I know some difficult decisions have to be made with cuts to funding, but this seems like a very poorly thought out idea.

Comment 2: Plenty of people use compost bins and have no trouble with rats or foxes.

Comment 3: If they are well-designed and well-managed- which is very easily accomplished. If 75% of this borough composted their waste at home then they could have their bins collected every six-weeks. It's amazing what doesn't need to be put into landfill.

Comment 4: tell that to people who live in flats and have no access to compost bins.

Comment 5: As far as I am aware, flats normally have sheds to put rubbish in, away from property. Even a small block of flats will normally have somewhere for temporary storage of rubbish.

Comment 6: I suggest you visit the borough and look at the breakdown of the housing stock before spouting cliches.

Comment 7: Composting is for waste food. The black bin is for stuff that usually cannot be composted such as packaging - that comment doesn't solve or really relate to this. If the council randomly decides what services it will offer can we randomly decide how much we want to pay?

Comment 8: <blockquote>  The black bin is for stuff that usually cannot be composted such as packaging </blockquote>  Foxes, rats and other vermin don't really go looking for packaging, do they?

Comment 9: <blockquote>  As far as I am aware, flats normally have sheds to put rubbish in, </blockquote>  Please expand your awareness.It is extremely narrow.

As you can see, the proposal is not aimed at properties with communal facilities.

Comment 11: It won't attract vermin if the rubbish is all in the bins. Is Bury going to provide larger bins for families or provide bins for kitchen and garden waste to cut down the amount that goes to landfill?Many people won't fill the bins in 3 weeks - even when there was 5 of us here, we would have just about managed.

Comment 12: Expect Bury to be knee deep in rubbish by Christmas it's a lame brained Labour idea and before long it'll be once a month collections. I'm not sure what the rubbish collectors will be doing if there are any. We are moving back to the Middle Ages, expect plague and pestilence.

Comment 13: Food waste is placed in the brown bin along with garden waste. The collection schedule of once every 2 weeks for food/garden waste (brown bins) is unchanged. So the change in collection schedule of the grey bin from 2 to 3 weeks doesn't have any impact on vermin. I appreciate that there may be trouble with households using disposable nappies but If they are sealed up properly and the bin is closed it shouldn't be a problem. Our neighbour used to throw lots of disposable nappies in our grey bin and they often sat there for 4 weeks with no issues. I regularly walk past lots of grey bins in the Bury region that are spilling over with recyclable material like glass bottles, paper and cardboard.  Part of the solution in raising recycling rates should focus on more education about what can be recycled and consideration of fines/rewards to encourage good attitudes to waste disposal for the minority who refuse to change their behaviour.

Comment 14: <blockquote>  Foxes, rats and other vermin don't really go looking for packaging, do they? </blockquote>  No but they may be drawn to the smells from used nappies, or leftover food on waste packaging for example. I appreciate the knowing tone in your post though, especially as it wasn't related to a thing I wrote.

Comment 3: Yes household of 2, that's why I mentioned it. But we only put our bins out every 1 in 3 or 4 collection. Regarding nappies, from Stockport Council's website:""What are the options for residents with lots of disposable nappy waste? Residents could look at using Real Nappies - these are washable cotton nappies that can reused. Alternatively you can apply for an additional black wheelie bin""

Comment 4: <blockquote>  Residents could look at using Real Nappies - these are washable cotton nappies that can reused. </blockquote> Yes, we tried this with our first child. Our electricity bills could have paid for a top-class social worker.  There is no green solution to the nappy problem: disposables go into landfill while reusables have to be washed at high temperature and therefore use large quantities of electricity (not to mention water and environment-damaging detergents). For the parent, the choice is between (a) expenditure on disposables and (b) slightly lower expenditure on reusables combined with incredibly high electricity bills.

Comment 5: Not to mention the water needed to wash them. I'm not sure it is much more sustainable, I doubt they put much research into it prior to making this assumption.

Comment 6: <blockquote>  Plenty of good reusable nappies on the market... </blockquote>  Plenty of washing machine use needed to keep them clean, too.

Comment 7: <blockquote>  ""What are the options for residents with lots of disposable nappy waste?  Residents could look at using Real Nappies - these are washable cotton nappies that can reused.  Alternatively you can apply for an additional black wheelie bin""  </blockquote>  We use washable nappies, and they are great, but there's still some waste - namely the disposable liner that can't be put down the toilet. It's way less bulk than you get with a disposable nappy, but you've still got cack in your bin for two - or three - weeks.

Comment 8: <blockquote>  Plenty of good reusable nappies on the market ... </blockquote> Yes, but speaking from experience, you simply don't have time to wash them, when the baby is at that stage of getting through 10 a day. Also, a lot of people with new babies nowadays live in tiny flats and have no space to dry dozens of nappies, at least not if they also want to wash their own clothes from time to time.  Sure, if you were forced to, I expect you'd cope somehow. But most people when they're extremely sleep deprived prefer the easy life.

Comment 9: reusables have to be washed at high temperature and therefore use large quantities of electricity My washing machine takes in hot water, which usually comes from my solar panel [1]. Electricity consumption is not large. For many years manufacturers have been saving themselves money by not fitting a hot fill and thus dumping higher running costs on customers. My washing machine is getting elderly. So I have looked at its replacement. That too will take in hot water. It will be considerably more expensive in first cost, but the running costs will be lower as it will make even better use if hot water than the current one. Nobody has yet mentioned nappy library schemes. Responses also miss the point. This is not a reduction in bin collections, it is just collecting bins differently. As the article says  <blockquote>  It affects the grey bins used for general household waste which can't be recycled. The green and blue coloured bins for paper, glass and plastic will be collected more often than they are currently - every three weeks instead of monthly. </blockquote>  I put my residual waste bin out once a quarter. It is never that full when I do. Most of what little waste I produce goes for composting/recycling. [1] which is busy generating hot water at the moment.

Comment 10: I intended to use reusables, at least in the day, but never got round to it what with being unwell after the birth and then knackered. I went back to work full time when my baby was 7 months old and struggle with getting clothes, bedding and towels for the three of us washed and dried without adding nappies as well. Where I used to live in the Rhondda they brought in fortnightly collections just after my son was born - horrible because in lots of houses there is no access at the back and no front garden so you have to store everything out the back then carry it through your house - but at least they started recycling disposable nappies.

Comment 11: There's quite a detailed bit of research <a href=""http://www.nappyinformationservice.co.uk/docs/SCHO0808BOIR-E-E.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Short version, if you have an inefficient washing machine, wash the nappies hotter than you need to, tumble dry them all the time and wash less than a full load every time then reusables can be worse. If you wash full loads at 60 in a reasonably efficient washing machine and air dry as much as possible the total environmental impact is lower for reusables than disposables for the first child and it drops further with every child that uses the same nappies (we used them on both of ours, they were second hand when we got them and they've been passed on so they'll have done for at least 4 children before).

Comment 12: Right, so possibly a small gain for the price of more inconvenience. All for the sake of making effectively zero difference to the environment. The smugness bonus might be the tipping point though.

Comment 13: A potentially small environmental gain if you use them with one child (and not that small if you use the washing machine efficiently and don't tumble dry) and then chuck them away, a potentially significant gain if you use them for more than one child. The ones we used had been through at least three children before we were done with them and were only in slightly worse condition than they started when we passed them on. I don't know how many children they'll last through but it's going to be at least half a dozen. Plus if you get them second hand they're cheaper (or free, we freecycled ours when we were done with them) so definitely easier on the wallet in the long run even with the costs of washing.
