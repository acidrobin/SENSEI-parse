18,Climate change is man made.,"Main topic: Climate change is man made.

Comment 1: Of course climate changes. The climate has been warming for about the last 12,000 years, since the peak of the last ice. When this interglacial period ends, the climate may well cool again and take us into another ice age. Get over it.

Comment 2: 'Get over it'? No, maybe best if you get informed.  March on record, at 0.71C (1.28F) above the 20th century average of 12.3C (54.1F).The combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for April 2014 tied with 2010 as the highest on record for the month, at 0.77C (1.39F) above the 20th century average of 13.7C (56.7F).The combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for May 2014 was record highest for this month, at 0.74C (1.33F) above the 20th century average of 14.8C (58.6F).The combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for June 2014 was the highest on record for the month, at 0.72C (1.30F) above the 20th century average of 15.5C (59.9F).

Comment 3: Thank you for confirming with facts what I said about the climate warming. Now can you please inform me why this isn't just an interglacial warm period and we may expect the climate to cool into another ice over the next several thousand years?

Comment 4: The IPCC has published at least 5 reports. One has around 27 pages of references. There were over 9,000 peer reviewed scientific papers published in 2012-13, all confirming man-made climate change. It's all on line and free, fully referenced, etc, so over to you.

Comment 5: Hello, Mr Bolt. I thought your standard line was things have been getting colder since 1998? Nothing like denying that the sky is up, trains run on tracks and Mr Rabbit is a dimwit.

Comment 6: Okay, try a big-picture view. The Pleistocene era has been characterised by a whole series of ice ages separated by interglacial warm periods, such as the one we live in now. There is no reason to think this cycle will not continue and the IPCC certainly can not tell us.

Comment 7: Ur, no. My name's not Mr Bolt and my standard line is that things have been getting warmer for the last 12,000 years. Whether the 'sky is up' is surely a matter of perspective. Trains do mostly run on tracks. And if 'Mr Rabbit' is Tony Abbot, you're spot on.

Comment 8: You are wrong,<a href=""http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/~/media/shared/documents/policy/Climate%20Change%20Statement%20Addendum%202013%20Final.ashx"" rel=""nofollow"">Astronomical calculations indicate that this period of low insolation and associated cool conditions should continue for about another 1,000 years. Nevertheless, after 1900 the overall decline in temperature sharply reversed.</a>It is better to check that you are correct factually first, it stops you appearing ignorant.

Comment 9: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/at-least-three-quarters-of-climate-change-is-man-made-1.9538"" rel=""nofollow"">At least 75% of climate change is man-made.</a> Because of a rapid warming trend over the past 30 years, the Earth is now reaching and passing through the warmest levels seen in the last 12,000 years

Comment 10: Nothing to see hear move along...

Comment 11: Get over itMatey, that is what we are on about. Implementingmthe solution.

Comment 12: 2014 temperature's compared with 2010 temperatures? This is pathetic. How about comparing the temperatures to averages in the 1930's, for example! If you, the story would be very different.

Comment 13: <blockquote>  Of course climate changes. The climate has been warming for about the last 12,000 years, since the peak of the last ice. </blockquote>  That wasn't a peak in the last ice age, that was the low of the last glacial within the ice age, and we're in an interglacial in the same ice age. If you see ice caps on Greenland and Antarctica, it's an ice age, period. So, that means outside of an ice age it's usually much warmer . Why's that do you think? Fire pixies?

Comment 14: Did you proof read that before you sent it or is posting random drivel your hobby?

Comment 15: There are lies, bigger lies and then statistics.The contention that mans contribution ""is very likely"" is poor science to say the least.

Comment 16: <blockquote>  The contention that mans contribution ""is very likely"" is poor science to say the least. </blockquote>  The contention that atmospheric CO2 -- an excess of which is entirely of our making -- has a marked warming effect on a planet is as solid as Venus. You're welcome to go there on a fact-finding mission to check it out. Stay as long as you need. Don't feel the need to hurry back.

Comment 17: ...poor science that Tony Abbott accepts.. ..maybe you could point out which political party does not have a climate change policy costing billions to address.. have a go Dougy.. MAKE SOMETHING UP..  I'm up for a laugh this morning as I am every morning when I read a conservatives comment..

Comment 18: Wrong Denialist argument, as usual. We all know that the planet goes through cycles, we don't need your little self to tell us. But what your crappy brain still doesn't understand, is that the current warming trend that started in about 1600 has accelerated since the second half of the 20th century. It is such acceleration (that is not smooth, as it is affected by the roughly 11 year solar cycles) that tells you that the planet is warming beyond its natural cycle. That excess warming is what the greenhouse effect of industrial CO2 emissions explains. Now, get over it once and for all, copy this and paste it somewhere, so you can remember... as you do that, you may sit out in your porch, waiting for the Little Ice Age to come if that's what you wish.... good luck!

Comment 19: Yep ...............another 18 years without accelerated warming should prove it for all time. And the ocean surface temps...a waste of time and printers ink.

Comment 20: Doug, I have tried to teach you (across websites) about climate change for some time now, and you still don't learn. So, once again. Denialists start their ""hiatus"" in 1998 (an El Nino year with record high annual value of temperature anomaly). Following 1998 we were on the descending curve of a solar cycle, that lasts about 11 years. This is recurrent, and during the accelerated phase of global warming there have been previous periods of periodical slow downs in warming associated with solar cycle minima. Now, the 1998 temperature anomaly record was broken in 2010, that is 12 years later, thus signalling the end of the low phase of the solar cycle and the initiation of the higher radiation phase. Therefore the accelerated phase is back on track. Your ""18 years without accelerated warming"" is just a lie, please just stop repeating lies. Moreover, during the ""hiatus"" the trend has always been towards warming, although at a decreased rate for the reason I explained above. There has been NO overall cooling during that period. Denialists just like to scavenge for small periods of temporary cooling to prove their point, that only demonstrate that they are scavengers of ad hoc, cherry picked evidence. Real scientists know and use the full information available: the inter-decadal records of temperature anomaly show relentless warming. While you keep on waiting and crossing your fingers for the Little Ice Age to come ask the farmers of Australia how is that climate going for them.... See you in January 2015 for the temperature anomaly of 2014: The hiatus is over!

Comment 21: Whether you believe that Climate changes naturally or is man made is not the point of the article. It is there are serious problems that are going to impact on us and we should be thinking about how to plan for these upcoming events now rather than when the problems eventuate.It is called Forward Planning

Comment 24: Brilliant link, SirGeo, I urge everyone to go there and read.... and think!Regarding the last figures on Arctic and Antarctic sea ice where the values of sea ice anomaly has been decreasing in the North (as expected from global warming) but slightly increasing in the South (which may seem somewhat counter-intuitive), readers should consider that Arctic sea ice is already made up of salty water, whereas in Antarctica the sea ice around the continent is also affected by the melting of the freshwater ice on land. As freshwater ice melts (because of global warming), it decreases salinity around the coast thus increasing the freezing point temperature, therefore favouring the appearance of sea ice even under global warming conditions. There are other likely factors as well to explain the difference, but that's a pretty obvious one.

Comment 25: <blockquote>  is poor science to say the least. </blockquote>  Oh look, a random shill says that 97% of climate scientists are conducting ""poor science"". Based on what?

Comment 27: DougofArmidale said:There are lies, bigger lies and then statistics.. The sequence goes like this: LiesBig liesStatisticsFossil fuel climate science

","Comment 1 (attacks Main topic): climate change is not due to pollution, global warming is a natural process that's going to take us to another ice age.

Comment 2 (attacks Comment 1): does not agree with 1st commentor, climate change, highest temperature over global land and ocean surfaces in the last years.

Comment 3 (attacks Comment 2): 1 commentor replied to 2 commentor, confirming his theory that global warming is going to end with another ice age.

Comment 4 (attacks Comment 3): 2 commentor replied to 1, climate change and there are many scientific studies to confirm that theory.

Comment 5 (attacks Comment 1): sarcastic comment to commentor 1, the theory that climate change naturally is a banal comment.

Comment 6 (attacks Comment 4): commentor 1 says that since pleistocene there have been a whole series of ice ages separeted by interglacial warm periods.

Comment 7 (attacks Comment 5): commentor 1 replied to 5, confirming his opinion that things have been getting warmer for the last 12,000 years.

Comment 8 (attacks Comment 7): doen't agree to commentor 1,another ice age is not possible as astronomical calculation indicated and after 1900 the overall decline in temperature sharply reversed.

Comment 9 (attacks Comment 7): climate change is man-made, global warming is reaching and passing through the warmest levels in the last 12,000 years.

Comment 10 (attacks Comment 1): 

Comment 11 (attacks Comment 1): not agree with commentor 1, accept the fact that climate change, and implementing solution.

Comment 12 (attacks Comment 2): not agree with commentor 2, comparing should be made between the last 90 yesrs, not in 4 years.

Comment 13 (attacks Comment 1): the commentor says that earth is in an interglacial age because of the ice cups on antartica and greenland, so we're in a warmer period.

Comment 14 (attacks Comment 12): sarcastic, not informed.

Comment 15 (attacks Comment 14): the contention that mans contribution ""is very likely"" is poor science.

Comment 16 (attacks Comment 15): there is an excess of co2, proved by missions, which is entirely of our making, so that's warming the planet.

Comment 17 (attacks Comment 15): is political matter that allow to manage big amount of money.

Comment 18 (attacks Comment 1): global warming is clearly due to the enhanced of industrial co2, that process started in about 1600 and has accelerated since the second half of the 20th century.

Comment 19 (attacks Comment 18): the article is irrelevant, denialist.

Comment 20 (attacks Comment 19): there is clear evidence of climate change and global warming. denialists reinterpret and cherry pick the data to suit their purposes, cites the anomalous data gathered during the laste solar cycles as evidence that the accelerated warming phase is back on track.

Comment 21 (attacks Comment 1): he agrees with the article,there are serious problems that are going to impact the enviroment, the solution could be a forward planning to prevent upcoming events.

Comment 22 (attacks Comment 19): conservative thought.

Comment 12: I guess Rupert's papers will be spinning worldwide crop failures as 'new obesity miracle cure!!!!!'

Comment 13: Climate Change! The new Soviet Science of the 21st century. There is no proof from the tens of thousands of research papers worldwide to justify the conclusions that are being preached. What we have are just theories!  And the theoretical predictions of the year 2000 have come and gone without any evidence of climate change. The same goes for every year science the Soviet like science came forth. What we have is simply this:  The authorities are telling us all that we must obey - even if there is no proof to justify this "" science. "" And unless we obey, we are called names, punished and our names are registered as non-believes. Soviet "" science "" is just the same. In time everyone will be too embarrassed to mention the term: climate change.

Comment 14: You forgot to say, ""in my uniformed uninformed opinion.""

Comment 15: I believe it is predicted to be 28 degrees in my home town tomorrow. They don't always get it right but they can identify at what point the weather systems changed to alter the prediction. Scientists are doing this kind of modelling with climatology right now. What part of modelling do you have a problem with? Large scale for producers use this modelling extensively and it has helped feed millions for years.

Comment 16: <blockquote>  In time everyone will be too embarrassed to mention the term: climate change. </blockquote>  Dunno. We've had now, what is it, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/world-breaks-temperature-record-june-hottest-may"" rel=""nofollow"">around three hundred and fifty months in a row of above-average global temperatures</a>? What would you call that, if not climate change? Ice melt? We're currently losing well over a trillion tonnes of ice each decade from the Antarctic and Greenland ice shelves, the two main continental ice reserves on the planet; the summer Arctic sea ice may well be gone within a few short years; amost every glacier on the planet is in full retreat. Here in Australia, the exacerbation of drought conditions over the past thirty or forty years has been linked by careful research and detailed meteorological observations to a change in Southern Ocean currents and wind systems connected to -- spoiler alert -- climate change. Moisture-bearing air just isn't being delivered to the southern half of the continent in the way that it used to be, and all the indications are that this situation is going to deteriorate further as the currents which could help us move further offshore in response to the warming atmosphere. This almost certainly means yet worse droughts, yet worse fire seasons -- oh, I forgot, Tiny Habit has reminded us there's no connection between climate change and bushfire. Silly me. Proof? You're thinking of mathematics, perhaps. Science doesn't deal in proof. It deals in evidence, and there's that in abundance. I'd suggest you open your eyes. And lay off the scare quotes.

Comment 17: The new Soviet Science of the 21 st century..... bwaaaahahahahaha... ..where do you go with that ? No wonder the right call the left elitist, anyone with an IQ above that of year six student would be elitist to these morons on legs..

Comment 18: Interesting... not that it is very informative though ... There is a great deal of the planet that has all year round warm or hot climate and warm climates are quite enjoyable... This is part of the positive sides of climate change... I mean warming ( assuming it really warms) whether it is a natural phenomenon or as some suggest, a man made phenomenon. Just build better infrastructure ( ours is equivalent to under developed nations) and manage it like any other risk.

Comment 19: Are you referring to Renewable Energy infrastructure?

Comment 20: denialist are just dumb conservatives ideologues...

Comment 21: <blockquote>  ""Whatever some people might think, global warming is occurring..."" . </blockquote>  I consider myself 'some people' and from the Australian News dated July 12th 2014 - Headline 'Brisbane hits coldest temperature in 103 years' . Not since July 28 1911 had Brisbane felt that cold, getting down to a brisk 2.6C at 6.41am. . It was brisk enough to refresh my health that morning, I can tell you. .

Comment 22: Go look up weather and climate, because these kinds of posts make you look like an uneducated fool.

Comment 23: denialist are dumb ideologues...

Comment 24: Brilliant deductive approach: one single cold Brisbane morning proves that global warming is a hoax! A Nobel prize must be waiting (but only for some people)...

Comment 25: <blockquote>  Australian News dated July 12th 2014 </blockquote>  It was cold one day, hence no AGW. Are you that stupid without taking pills?

Comment 26: Did they consider ranking all the potential threats to public health and then consider where climate change sat ? I'd say obesity, inactivity, and smoking would all rank higher than an esoteric issue like climate change. Year-on-year there hasn't been a downturn in argicultural production for the past 300 years despite increasing global temperatures and CO2 atmospheric concentration. Look at the graph from 1961 to present, we are swimming in food. Its almost like CO2 is plant food, rather than poison.

24,Prince Charles should not own so much land. ,"Main topic: Prince Charles should not own so much land. 

Comment 1: How about he hand over all 'his' land to the hard working tenant farmers?

Comment 2: <blockquote>  For me, well done for caring and an extra well done for Not putting off a trip that had been prearranged because of difficulties. </blockquote>  I've seen some ridiculous post on CiF but this one takes the biscuit. he's doing it for the publicity, he wants to put on the King costume and lord it over his subjects and grab vast amounts of tax payers money, while a large proportion of the population can only scrape by with the help from food banks.

Comment 3: Hear Hear. He's seen his people suffering, and he's done what anyone with a personal fortune of £346m would do. He's dug deep into the pockets of his charitable trust - and come up with £50,000. Somerset is saved!

Comment 4: <blockquote>  Biggest problem Charles faces now a days is the critics who simply cannot match his compassion and knowledge of the people of this country. </blockquote>  The biggest problem he faces is that, like a previous Prince of Wales (the one that became Edward VIII), he is a parasite who turs up at the scenes of disaster or economic suffering, says 'Something must be done', and then skoots back to one of his palatial homes, then to dress up in one of his many pretend Field Marshal-Air Marshal-Admiral uniforms. These people are a joke, one that we have to pay to support.

Comment 5: <blockquote>  His' lands, inluding the Duchy of Coornwall, support thousands of livelihoods, and I couldn't imagine him setting his seal of approval to fracking. </blockquote>   I'm sure these people could still have their livelihoods, without Charles owning their land. Which was of course stolen by force of arms and murder by his anscestors.

Comment 6: Could not agree more!!

Comment 7: A large proportion of the population... Um, what proportion would that be, exactly? Or even approximately, for that matter? I'd guess a ""large proportion"" would normally be taken to mean 50%+...or perhaps 25% by other definitions...or 10% at least, surely, and even that seems an odd use of the phrase? I mean, if only 10% of the population voted Conservative, would you agree with someone who claimed that ""a large proportion of the population supports the Tories""? But let's be generous, and call 10% a large proportion. That would mean that about 6.4 million people in the UK only scrape by with help from food banks, yes? That's odd: I don't think food banks currently claim to provide food for more than at most 200,000 people in the UK. Let's increase that (in your favour) by a half to 300K . That's, um, less than 1/20 of 6 million. So in fact in a generous approx guesstimate sort of way you might be justified in saying that 0.5% of the population can only scrape by with the help of food banks. This would seem to imply that you think one-half of one per cent is ""a large proportion"". How would you describe the other 99.5%, I wonder? I've seen some ridiculous posts on CiF but this one takes the biscuit...oh sorry, perhaps you've got copyright on that phrase.

Comment 8: 40 trusts and charities for the countryside, or given from a trust you started up £50,000 to help those in people suffering in Somerset from the floods? No. So who is the prat? Money that is ours really - unless Charlie boy has been putting in some shifts at McDonald's or something and he's putting up the money out of own pocket.  He inherited the land he ""owns"" and pretty much everything that comes with it, still nice that he can throw a few pennies back.

Comment 9: Am I one of the biggest landowners in the country, do I avoid paying tax on my inherited wealth, do I have butlers and helpers, do I have round the clock security and a free ride in life? If he really truly cared he wouldn't be in the position he is.....

Comment 10: Charles hasn't done anything himself - he's had them started on his behalf done with money he hasn't earned and run by others. He just pops along. The money "" donated "" isn't even from his own pocket ( our money really ) but from one of the numerous charities funded by others. Same as his dad and the Duke of Edinburgh Award which he never even bothered to do.  Fine, if you're impressed with this kind of vacuous "" celebrity "" culture but many of us are not in thrall to this family of benefit recipients.

Comment 11: Sorry but we spend more than that to fly him to a trade fair. I'd call £50,000 of someone else's money, a drop in the water!

Comment 12: Ah yes the charitable prince with over 40 charities,Must be such a busy man with allthose charities opened by others in his name, which he has nothing to do with but the odd bit of paperwork or a personal appearance every few years.Im sure if 60boy had the time, money and logistics that he probably would go to offer some sort of help, so no need to be so rude because he called your precious prince a prat.Its not hard to jet off to stricken parts of the country when its your job to do so (and I use the word ""job"" very lightly here) the decision was made for you by a PR agent and every move thereafter was all pre arranged by said PR dept. And &#163;50.000 from a multi millionaire???Is that not the same as a morbidly obese person throwing away the last crisp after eating the whole packet, just to placate his conscience? Oh and possibly lobbying politicians for less tax on one of his bloody great homes obviously shows he's a man great benevolence.

Comment 13: <blockquote>  Have you made the effort to see how the local people are, or started approximately 40 trusts and charities for the countryside, or given from a trust you started up £50,000 to help those in people suffering in Somerset from the floods? No. </blockquote>  No, we're too busy earning a living rather than swaning round playing at being 'Prince of Wales'. The man is a parasite. Every penny he has has been stolen.

Comment 14: <blockquote>  Am I one of the biggest landowners in the country, do I avoid paying tax on my inherited wealth, do I have butlers and helpers, do I have round the clock security and a free ride in life? If he really truly cared he wouldn't be in the position he is..... </blockquote>  Good point...nonetheless, I've recommended MrBlueberry's comment too because both of your comments contain integrity. I don't like the huge disparities between resource availability between people in this country. We're all more isolated from each other because of this. One group worry about their possessions, obsessive portfolio enlargements, another struggle needing a humiliating food bank voucher after working a 12- hour gig at a care home... I want our public services back. I want leaders taking responsibility for what they're responsible for.  The royal likes his environmental issues but he's not in charge. It's not his remit.  It's Cameron's job & at the moment & all he can say through a nameless spokesperson is, ""it's unacceptable!"" right, thanks Dave, that doesn't cut it.  Neither is setting up others to blame for what is Owen ""Climate-Change-Entrepreneur-Opportunity"" Paterson's problem. <a href=""http://www.endsreport.com/41653/environment-agency-cuts-surviving-the-surgeons-knife"" rel=""nofollow"">Environment Agency cuts: surviving the surgeon's knife</a>3 January 2014  ""As England's hit by widespread flooding, the Environment Agency is in the process of slashing 15% of its staff...how the organisation will cope and what the cuts will mean for flood and environmental protection..."" That's Westminster's decisions, not local councils or departments current government are responsible for but don't like to do so. I don't know if anything stops the royal from giving away his belongings to the people & establishing an environmental cooperative, permaculture, wind turbines, simplicity, learning, working, resting & community...I'd think it a worthwhile endeavor.

Comment 15: He has given a tiny proportion of his vast wealth to make a show of helping out. As for the claim he has 'removed himself from London' this is so ridiculous as to invite nothing but derision. He has made a long habit of interfering in government to demand changes in laws that financially benefit him personally. He is a corrupt, grubby little man. I suppose you have missed all the Guardian reporting on the black spider memos and his other assaults on the democratic system we supposedly live under.

Comment 16: Most of the 'assaults on the democratic process' seem to be him offering his opinion on schemes he doesn't like. He doesn't have any power to stop them, so if the developers decide to take his advice on board and change their plans, that's fine.

Comment 17: You haven't read the papers this last year have you. He and his mother have had secret meetings with ministers in which they block legislation they don;t like and which would affect them personally financially. he also writes memos to ministers to inform them of things he wants done or blocked. The governments refuses to release any details of this covert lobbying and the Guardian sued and failed to get that ban overturned. The man and the institution are a pernicious blot in the constitution of the country, a reminder we live under a medieval government set up.

Comment 18: Ah okay thought you were talking about his architectural busybodying. I don't really know the details of the story you're talking about. It depends what it means to 'block' legislation, if it's simply offering his opinion then that's no different to other lobby groups that government can choose to listen to or not; if he's threatening some kind of royal veto then that's much more serious.

Comment 19: The architecture and talking to plants stuff is stupid but not dangerous. No, this is the reporting that has been done by the Graun and the Indy over the past year. Ministers show draft legislation that may affect the Queen or Charles to their staff. If they object to any clauses they are removed even before the draft bill gets to Parliament. Charles in particular has been aggressive in using this power to protect the commercial interests of the Duchy of Cornwall. All very dodgy stuff indeed. They also get a review of draft bills before they pass the final stages in Parliament.

25,"The recent floods are a ""once in 100 years"" event. ","Main topic: The recent floods are a ""once in 100 years"" event. 

Comment 1: Saying that the floods were hailed as a ""once-in-100-years"" event, is misleading. 1:100 year flood is a technical way of describing the scale of the flood, and doesn't mean that a similar size event could not occur 2 years later.

Comment 2: It means that there is 1% probability of a flood of this magnitude IF similar conditions prevail. It may happen next year or may not happen in 20 next years.

Comment 3: Precisely.

Comment 4: And basing claims of likelihood on past data ignores the fact that the atmosphere is warming, that a warmer atmosphere and sea means that more moisture is picked up from the Atlantic and then dumps on the UK. So rain like this is going to become ever more frequent. Add rising sea levels to that and within a short time it is likely that the Somerset levels will once again become large marshy and tidal waterways. One of the options for the name Somerset is from the Saxon phrase that means something like 'dwellers by marshy lakes'. Heading that way again.

53,Journalists often ask challenging questions to politicians.,"Main topic: Journalists often ask challenging questions to politicians.

Comment 1: <blockquote>   ""It is routine for journalists to ask you questions and usually the candidates answer."" </blockquote>  In what parallel universe? I'd say the standard practice is the opposite. In fact, outside of press conferences or arranged interviews, the rest is becoming known as ""ambush journalism"" -- which, given the connotation of 'ambush', I take to be pejorative.

Comment 2: Ah, but this is a British journalist following a long standing tradition of not allowing public figures to dictate the terms of a conversation - unlike the generally more wimpy, conciliatory American versions.

Comment 3: No. ""Ambush journalism"" is problematical when applied to celebrities going about their ordinary daily business, but not to politicians who are running to represent their future constituents - especially not at a campaign event. The job of the free press is to interrogate them on behalf of these people. Hence, ""fourth estate"". The politician doesn't have to answer, but calling the police to have journalists removed is a bit rich. You're clearly confusing the role of journalist with that of press agent.

Comment 4: I'm just going by wikipedia and my own casual empiricism (flawed as it may be). From wikipedia:  <blockquote>  Ambush journalism Ambush journalism refers to aggressive tactics practiced by journalists to suddenly confront and question people who otherwise do not wish to speak to a journalist. The practice has particularly been applied by television journalists, on news shows like The O'Reilly Factor [1] and 60 Minutes[citation needed] and by Geraldo Rivera and other local television reporters conducting investigations.    The practice has been sharply criticized by journalists and others as being highly unethical and sensational, while others defend it as the only way to attempt to provide those subject to it an opportunity to comment for a report. This can usually be discerned by the level of physical aggression the journalist displays and in the time allowed for an uninterrupted answer.  </blockquote>  Since a press agent doesn't usually ask probing questions of his client, on the record, at even press conferences or interviews, I'll have to depart from your view that I've confused the roles of press agents and journalists, though I will concede there may be divergent majority attitudes towards ambush journalism on different sides of the pond (just as there are differences in libel laws, which might make the British counterparts something less than the searching advocates of truth some might imagine them to be). That said, having the police called is something else altogether, especially when conducted on someone else's property that offers public access.  It probably isn't much appreciated on the other side of the pond that some ""campaign events"" are treated as private endeavors, even when conducted in public. For instance, the record is full of instances where, having received a permit, Obama campaigners banned unsympathetic public from ""campaign events"" on public property that were little more than dog and pony shows for the cameras, designed to show Obama surrounded by nothing but supporters. And this is not an Obama phenomenon exclusively. Far from it.

Comment 5: <blockquote>  (just as there are differences in libel laws, which might make the British counterparts something less than the searching advocates of truth some might imagine them to be). </blockquote>  On the contrary, it is the far stronger libel laws in the UK that forces journalists there to be careful to print only the truth.

Comment 6: Granted, but in printing only the truth, it foregoes some truth beyond the evidentiary burden on the respondent. Being more careful doesn't necessarily make one more searching.

Comment 7: Nonsense! We THE People depend on journalists for our information. Politicians who are not carpetbaggers and stand for something, are ALWAYS pleased to get their message out to THE People!

Comment 8: May i suggest you're over-representing the case somewhat: ""truth"" is a highly subjective and debatable matter; the UK's laws merely hold reporting and journalism to a higher standard of factual veracity and accuracy than the 'anything goes' substandards found in the US.

Comment 9: Perhaps if you read the book by this author (probably promoted to the right of the article) you may change your mind.

54,"American politicians are corrupt, nepotistic, and power-hungry.","Main topic: American politicians are corrupt, nepotistic, and power-hungry.

Comment 1: This would be hilarious if it wasn't so representative of the state of US politics, particularly (but not only) on the Republican side. Those people just want to get into office, mingle with their (male, white, Christian) friends, play big-shot politics (hey mum, I'm a senator!), cash in, but not be held accountable for anything. I genuinely don't think public service ever comes into it. What a joke.

Comment 2: There actually was a case a few months ago where a Republican Congressman, Michael Grimm, physically threatened a reporter for asking a question about campaign finance irregularities. Grimm has since resigned over those irregularities.  This isn't to say Brown would do the same, but when you look at how a lot of Republican elected officials behave in public, a certain caution is called for when dealing with them. A whip and a chair might be handy.

Comment 3: <blockquote>  mingle with their (male, white, Christian) friends </blockquote>  Easily interchanged with: male, white, Jewish - See Sen. Chuck Schumer, never met a Wall Street Banker he didn't like to take money from.

Comment 4: Chuck Schumer, who represents my state, NY, is a nauseating example of the breed. By the way, old Chuck was the author of the law that made the Hobby Lobby decision possible. And in true Schumer fashion, he and his staff have been hiding from questions ever since.

Comment 5: <blockquote>   mingle with their (male, white, Christian) friends    Easily interchanged with: male, white, Jewish - See Sen. Chuck Schumer, never met a Wall Street Banker he didn't like to take money from.  </blockquote>  Not so easily interchanged for Republicans, it would seem.  The last Jewish Republican member of Congress, Eric Cantor, lost his re-election last month. There will be no Jewish Republicans in either the House or the Senate after his term is up. All of the Republicans are now Christian (or at least they profess to be, I'm sure there must be some who are agnostic/atheist, but can't admit to that in public). Republicans have no African-American members of Congress. There are 7 Latinos, one of whom is a woman. The numbers for the last (113th) Congress were 233 Republicans in the House of Representatives, and 45 in the Senate. Out of the 278 Republican members of Congress, 252 were men, 26 were women. 271 were white, 7 were Latino. 277 were Christian, 1 was Jewish. That looks pretty heavily weighted in favour of ""male, white, Christian"" from where I'm standing.

Comment 6: Bankers,brokers, and other big influence bullies seed both sides of the schizoid field of US politics, just to make sure they have leverage in case those pesky voters defy the odds.

Comment 7: All of them. You can see them as ""puppies"" rising thru the ranks, licking the proper boots and pretending to be caring as they make fun of the average folk. Most of them I have seen like this are Democrats, esp those who ruined Detroit. Look at Detroit. This is what our whole nation might look at after all the looting for personal wealth and contracts handed out to cronies and family.
